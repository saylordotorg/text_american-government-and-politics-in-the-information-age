Walt argue that the activities of interest groups, notably the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aipac.org">American Israel Public Affairs Committee</a>, are one reason why, since World War II, the United States has provided more direct economic and military support to Israel than any other ally and pursues a policy of preserving and enhancing Israel’s security.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_039">John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt, <em class="emphasis">The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy</em> (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2007). See also the critique by Robert C.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Interest Groups Are (or Are Not) Successful</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p01">The main factors determining an interest group’s effectiveness are its assets, objectives, alliances, the visibility of its involvement in policy decisions, and its responses to political change and crises, plus, of course, the media’s depiction of it.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Assets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p01">Successful interest groups have prestige, respected leadership, political skills, and ample finances. The Business Roundtable, composed of the chief executives of the two hundred leading corporations, has them all and thus has access to and influence on policymakers. Monetary assets allow groups to contribute to political campaigns through their political action committees (PACs).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p02">The status and distribution of an interest group’s members also contribute to its success. Automobile dealers are influential and live, as do their employees, in congressional districts across the country. After President Barack Obama proposed putting automobile loans under the oversight of a new federal consumer authority aimed at protecting borrowers from abusive lender, the dealers’ lobbying arm, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nada.org">National Automobile Dealers Association</a>, organized opposition, including trips to Washington for some of the eighteen thousand dealers to meet and plead their case with their legislators.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_040">Eric Lichtblau, “Auto Dealers Campaign to Fend Off Regulation,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 16, 2010, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/business/17dealers.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/business/17dealers.html</a>.</span> Congress exempted auto dealers from the regulation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Objectives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p01">The ease or difficulty of achieving a group’s goals can determine its success. Preventing legislation from being enacted is usually easier than passing it. In a comprehensive study of interest group activities during the last two years of the Clinton administration and the first two years of the George W. Bush administration, researchers found that although some advocates succeed eventually in changing policy, “[t]he vast bulk of lobbying in Washington has to do not with the creation of new programs, but rather with the adjustment of existing programs or with the maintenance of programs just as they are.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_041">Frank R. Baumgartner, Jeffrey M. Berry, Marje Hojnacki, David C. Kimball, and Beth L. Leech, <em class="emphasis">Lobbying and Policy Change: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), 240. See also R. Kenneth Godwin and Barry J. Seldon, “What Corporations Really Want from Government: The Public Provision of Private Goods,” in <em class="emphasis">Interest Group Politics</em>, 6th ed., ed. Allan J. Cigler and Burdett A. Loomis (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 2002), 205–224.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p02">Moreover, legislation enacted over the opposition of powerful interest groups, tends to be watered down. Or the political costs of its passage are so heavy that its proponents in the presidential administration and Congress are discouraged from challenging the groups again.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Alliances</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p01">Interest groups sometimes cooperate with other groups to help them achieve a policy objective they could not accomplish alone. A coalition expands resources, broadens expertise, and adds to the credibility of the policy objectives. Alliances are often of natural allies such as the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.restaurant.org">National Restaurant Association</a>, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.anla.org">American Nursery and Landscape Association</a>, and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncaeonline.org">National Council of Agricultural Employers</a>, who united to oppose restrictions on immigration and penalties on businesses that employ illegal immigrants. But they can be made up of strange bedfellows, as when the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Rifle Association (NRA) allied to oppose the US Department of Justice putting raw, unsubstantiated data into a national computer network. For the ACLU, it was a violation of people’s right to privacy; for the NRA, it was a move toward denying people the right to bear arms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_042">Jeffrey M.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Visibility of Policy Involvement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s04_p01">Interest groups are often most successful when their activities are unreported by the media, unscrutinized by most policymakers, and hidden from the public. Opposition to a group’s activities is difficult when they are not visible. As one lobbyist observed, “A lobby is like a night flower, it thrives in the dark and dies in the sun.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_043">Jeffrey Goldberg, “Real Insiders,” <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em>, July 4, 2005, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/07/04/050704fa_fact">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/07/04/050704fa_fact</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s04_p02">In what are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">iron triangles</a><span class="glossdef">Congressional committees or subcommittees, bureaucratic agencies, and interest groups that together dominate policymaking in a policy area oftentimes with little visibility.</span></span>, or subgovernments, policy on a subject is often made by a relatively few people from Congress, the bureaucracy, and interest groups. A classic iron triangle has been veterans’ affairs policy. Members of Congress chairing the relevant committees and subcommittees and their aides, key agency administrators from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and representatives from interest groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) have interacted and dominated policymaking.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_044">J. Leiper Freeman, <em class="emphasis">The Political Process: Bureau-Legislative Committee Relations</em>, rev. ed. (New York: Random House, 1965).</span> This policymaking has taken place with low visibility and very little opposition to the benefits provided for veterans. In general, the news media pay little attention to iron triangles in the absence of conflict and controversy, and interest groups are likely to achieve many of their objectives.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Political Change and Crises</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s05_p01">Whether interest groups defend what they have or go on the offense to gain new benefits often depends on who is in control of the government. Some interest groups’ goals are supported or opposed far more by one political party than another. A new president or a change in party control of Congress usually benefits some groups while putting others at a disadvantage. The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2010 election put a brake on new regulation of business by Congress, reduced funds for regulators to hire staff and enforce regulation, and limited investigations of industry practices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s05_p02">Crises, especially ones extensively depicted by the media, often involve politicians and interest groups trying to achieve or prevent policy changes. Looking to exploit the horrific BP (British Petroleum) oil spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico (which was widely covered in the media and replete with images of the oil-infested waters and oil-coated beaches and wildlife), environmentalists and their congressional allies worked for “measures to extend bans on new offshore drilling, strengthen safety and environmental safeguards, and raise to $10 billion or more the cap on civil liability for an oil producer in a spill.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_045">Eric Lichtblau and Jad Mouaward, “Oil Companies Weigh Strategies to Fend Off Tougher Regulations,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 2, 2010, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/us/03lobby.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/us/03lobby.html</a>.</span> Opposing them were the oil and gas industry, which, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, spent $174.8 million on lobbying in 2009, and its allies in Congress from such oil states as Texas and Louisiana.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Relations between Interest Groups and Policymakers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p01">When viewed overall, there is a hierarchy in the influence of relations between interest groups and policymakers.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_046">These categories come from Samuel J. Eldersveld, “American Interest Groups,” in <em class="emphasis">Interest Groups on Four Continents</em>, ed. Henry W. Ehrmann (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1958), 187.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>At the top, the interest group makes policy. This is uncommon.</li>
            <li>More common, the group maintains close political relations with policymakers.</li>
            <li>The group has an unchallengeable veto status over some governmental decisions, for example, over a presidential appointment.</li>
            <li>The group receives some attention from policymakers but mainly has a pressure relationship with them.</li>
            <li>The group has only a potential reprisal relationship with policymakers; it can threaten to oppose a member of Congress at the next election.</li>
            <li>At the bottom of the ladder, rejected by policymakers, the group is left to agitate and resist; its public demonstrations usually signify its inability to achieve its objectives by less visible means.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p02">The relationships between interest groups and policymakers vary depending on the administration in power. Energy companies had a close political support and referral relationship with the George W. Bush administration but primarily a pressure relationship with the Obama administration. Relationships also vary by subject. For example, a Democratic president’s choice to head the US Department of Labor may have to be acceptable to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), but the union organization has little influence over other cabinet appointments.</p>

    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Benefits from Interest Groups?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p01">In Federalist No. 10, James Madison warns of the dangers of factions: “[A] number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_047">James Madison, “Federalist #10,” in Clinton Rossiter, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Federalist Papers</em> (New York: New American Library, 1961), 78; see also Library of Congress, THOMAS, “Federalist No. 10,” accessed April 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_10.html">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_10.html</a>.</span> Madison believed that factions were inevitable, because their causes were “sown in the nature of man.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_048">James Madison, “Federalist #10,” in <em class="emphasis">The Federalist Papers</em>, ed. Clinton Rossiter (New York: New American Library, 1961), 79.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_p02">Madison’s factions are not exactly today’s interest groups. Indeed, interest groups, by representing diverse segments of society, offset one of Madison’s concerns—the domination of the majority. Nonetheless, his warning raises important questions about the effects of interest groups.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Pluralism: Competition among Groups</h2>

For pluralists, the abundance of interest groups, the competition between them, and their representation of interests in society are inherent in American democracy. Bargaining between groups and ever-changing group alliances achieve a desirable dispersion of power or at least an acceptable balancing of the various interests in society.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_049">See Robert A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_s03_p01">The media often depict business interest groups negatively, which can limit the groups’ influence.

The photograph of this moment, prominently featured in the US and foreign media, has become an enduring image of business executives who place the interests and profits of their corporations above the public interest even if it requires them to engage in self-deception, defy common sense about the dangers of their products, and give deceptive testimony under oath.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_s03_p05">Had one sat through the several hours of hearings, watched them on television, or read the transcript, the executives would have come across as less defiant and more reasonable. They agreed to give Congress unpublished research documents, acknowledged that cigarettes may cause various health problems including cancer and heart disease, and admitted that they would prefer that their children not smoke.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_058">For an account of the hearing, see Philip J. Hilts, “Tobacco Chiefs Say Cigarettes Aren’t Addictive,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 15, 1994, accessed on March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes- aren-t-addictive.html</a>.</span> But the photo and its brief explanatory caption, not the complicated hearings, are the enduring image.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_s03_p06">Why does this image of venal, almost criminal, tobacco executives endure? Simply put, television news’ continuing coverage of the litigation by state attorneys general against the tobacco companies required vivid video to illustrate and dramatize an otherwise bland story. What better choice than the footage of the seven tobacco executives? Thus the image circulated over and over again on the nightly news and is widely available on the Internet years later.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s03_s03_p07">Numerous factors determine the success or failure of interest groups in achieving their policy objectives. These include their assets, objectives, alliances, visibility of their involvement in policy decisions, responses to political change and crises, and depictions in the media. Relatedly, there is a hierarchy of interest groups’ relations with policymakers. Pluralists regard interest groups as essential to American democracy; critics, however, believe that business interest groups are too dominant. Business interest groups have several advantages enabling them to achieve their policy objectives but also several disadvantages, including negative media depictions.</p>
