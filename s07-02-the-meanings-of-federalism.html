    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">The meaning of federalism has changed over time. During the first decades of the republic, many politicians held that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">states’ rights</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that holds that each state entered into a compact in ratifying the Constitution and can therefore decide whether or not to obey a law it considers unconstitutional.</span></span> allowed states to disobey any national government that in their view exceeded its powers. Such a doctrine was largely discredited after the Civil War. Then <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dual federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that divides power between national and state governments into distinct, clearly demarcated domains of authority.</span></span>, a clear division of labor between national and state government, became the dominant doctrine. During the New Deal of the 1930s, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cooperative federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that sees national, state, and local governments working together to address problems and implement public policies in numerous domains.</span></span>, whereby federal and state governments work together to solve problems, emerged and held sway until the 1960s. Since then, the situation is summarized by the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">competitive federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that stresses the conflict and compromise between national, state, and local governments.</span></span>, whereby responsibilities are assigned based on whether the national government or the state is thought to be best able to handle the task.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">States’ Rights</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">The ink had barely dried on the Constitution when disputes arose over federalism. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton hoped to build a strong national economic system; Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson favored a limited national government. Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian factions in President George Washington’s cabinet led to the first political parties: respectively, the Federalists, who favored national supremacy, and the Republicans, who supported states’ rights.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p01">In 1798, Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, outlawing malicious criticism of the government and authorizing the president to deport enemy aliens. In response, the Republican Jefferson drafted a resolution passed by Kentucky’s legislature, the first states’ rights manifesto. It set forth a compact theory, claiming that states had voluntarily entered into a “compact” to ratify the Constitution. Consequently, each state could engage in “nullification” and “judge for itself” if an act was constitutional and refuse to enforce it.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_015">Forrest McDonald, <em class="emphasis">States’ Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776–1876</em> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2000), 38–43.</span> However, Jefferson shelved states’ rights when, as president, he directed the national government to purchase the enormous Louisiana Territory from France in 1803.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p01">After the Revolutionary War, slavery waned in the North, where slaves were domestic servants or lone farmhands. In the South, labor-intensive crops on plantations were the basis of Southern prosperity, which relied heavily on slaves.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_016">This section draws on James M. McPherson, <em class="emphasis">Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p02">In 1850, Congress faced the prospect of new states carved from land captured in the Mexican War and debated whether they would be slave or free states. In a compromise, Congress admitted California as a free state but directed the national government to capture and return escaped slaves, even in free states. Officials in Northern states decried such an exertion of national power favoring the South. They passed state laws outlining rights for accused fugitive slaves and forbidding state officials from capturing fugitives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_017">Thomas D. Morris, <em class="emphasis">Free Men All: The Personal Liberty Laws of the North, 1780–1861</em> (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974).</span> The Underground Railroad transporting escaped slaves northward grew. The saga of hunted fugitives was at the heart of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel <em class="emphasis">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, which sold more copies proportional to the American population than any book before or since.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p08">The battle flag appeals to politicians seeking resonant images. But its multiple meanings can backfire. In 2003, former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, addressed the Democratic National Committee and said, “White folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals on the back ought to be voting with us, and not them [Republicans], because their kids don’t have health insurance either, and their kids need better schools too.” Dean received a rousing ovation, so he probably thought little of it when he told the <em class="emphasis">Des Moines Register</em>, “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_021">All quotes come from “Dems Battle over Confederate Flag,” CNN, November 2, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag">http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag</a>.</span> Dean, the Democratic front runner, was condemned by his rivals who questioned his patriotism, judgment, and racial sensitivity.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p09">The South’s defeat in the Civil War discredited compact theory and nullification. Since then, state officials’ efforts to defy national orders have been futile. In 1963, Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama to resist a court order to desegregate the all-white school. Eventually, he had no choice but to accede to federal marshals. In 1994, Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey, a pro-life Democrat, decreed he would not allow state officials to enforce a national order that state-run Medicaid programs pay for abortions in cases of rape and incest. He lost in court.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_023">David L.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dual Federalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p01">After the Civil War, the justices of the Supreme Court wrote, “The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_024"><em class="emphasis">Texas v. White</em>, 7 Wall. 700 (1869).</span> They endorsed dual federalism, a doctrine whereby national and state governments have clearly demarcated domains of power. The national government is supreme, but only in the areas where the Constitution authorizes it to act.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">The basis for dual federalism was a series of Supreme Court decisions early in the nineteenth century. The key decision was <em class="emphasis">McCulloch v. Maryland</em> (1819). The Court struck down a Maryland state tax on the Bank of the United States chartered by Congress. Chief Justice Marshall conceded that the Constitution gave Congress no explicit power to charter a national bank,<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_025"><em class="emphasis">McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).</span> but concluded that the Constitution’s necessary-and-proper clause enabled Congress and the national government to do whatever it deemed “convenient or useful” to exercise its powers. As for Maryland’s tax, he wrote, “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” Therefore, when a state’s laws interfere with the national government’s operation, the latter takes precedence. From the 1780s to the Great Depression of the 1930s, the size and reach of the national government were relatively limited. As late as 1932, local government raised and spent more than the national government or the states.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p01">National powers were expanded when Congress targeted obscenity, prostitution, and alcohol.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_026">This section draws on James A. Morone, <em class="emphasis">Hellfire Nation: The Politics of Sin in American History</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), chaps. 8–11.</span> In 1872, reformers led by Anthony Comstock persuaded Congress to pass laws blocking obscene material from being carried in the US mail. Comstock had a broad notion of sinful media: all writings about sex, birth control, abortion, and childbearing, plus tabloid newspapers that allegedly corrupted innocent youth.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p02">As a result of these laws, the national government gained the power to exclude material from the mail even if it was legal in individual states.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p03">The power of the national government also increased when prostitution became a focus of national policy. A 1910 exposé in <em class="emphasis">McClure’s</em> magazine roused President William Howard Taft to warn Congress about prostitution rings operating across state lines. The ensuing media frenzy depicted young white girls torn from rural homes and degraded by an urban “white slave trade.” Using the commerce clause, Congress passed the Mann Act to prohibit the transportation “in interstate commerce…of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_027">Quoted in James A. Morone, <em class="emphasis">Hellfire Nation: The Politics of Sin in American History</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), 266.</span> The bill turned enforcement over to a tiny agency concerned with antitrust and postal violations, the Bureau of Investigations. The Bureau aggressively investigated thousands of allegations of “immoral purpose,” including unmarried couples crossing state lines to wed and interracial married couples.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p04">The crusade to outlaw alcohol provided the most lasting expansion of national power. Reformers persuaded Congress in 1917 to bar importation of alcohol into dry states, and, in 1919, to amend the Constitution to allow for the nationwide prohibition of alcohol. Pervasive attempts to evade the law boosted organized crime, a rationale for the Bureau of Investigations to bloom into the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the equivalent of a national police force, in the 1920s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p05">Prohibition was repealed in 1933. But the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, its director from the 1920s to the 1970s, continued to call attention through news and entertainment media to the scourge of organized crime that justified its growth, political independence, and Hoover’s power. The FBI supervised film depictions of the lives of criminals like John Dillinger and long-running radio and television shows like <em class="emphasis">The FBI</em>. The heroic image of federal law enforcement would not be challenged until the 1960s when the classic film <em class="emphasis">Bonnie and Clyde</em> romanticized the tale of two small-time criminals into a saga of rebellious outsiders crushed by the ominous rise of authority across state lines.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Regulation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Other national reforms in the late nineteenth century that increased the power of the national government were generated by reactions to industrialization, immigration, and urban growth. Crusading journalists decried the power of big business. Upton Sinclair’s 1906 novel <em class="emphasis">The Jungle</em> exposed miserable, unsafe working conditions in America’s factories. These reformers feared that states lacked the power or were reluctant to regulate railroads, inspect meat, or guarantee food and drug safety. They prompted Congress to use its powers under the commerce clause for economic regulation, starting with the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 to regulate railroads and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to outlaw monopolies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">The Supreme Court, defending dual federalism, limited such regulation. It held in 1895 that the national government could only regulate matters <em class="emphasis">directly</em> affecting interstate commerce.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_028"><em class="emphasis">United States v. E. C. Knight</em>, 156 US 1 (1895).</span> In 1918, it ruled that Congress could not use the commerce clause to deal with local matters like conditions of work.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s01_p01">Cooperative federalism was weakened when a series of Supreme Court decisions, starting in the 1950s, caused states to face much closer supervision by national authorities.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s02_p01">In 1963, President Lyndon Johnson proposed extending the New Deal policies of his hero, FDR. Seeking a “Great Society” and declaring a “War on Poverty,” Johnson inspired Congress to enact massive new programs funded by the national government. Over two hundred new grants programs were enacted during Johnson’s five years in office. They included a Jobs Corps and Head Start, which provided preschool education for poor children.</p>

Dye, <em class="emphasis">American Federalism: Competition among Governments</em> (Lexington, MA: Lexington Books, 1990).</span> Overlapping powers and responsibilities create friction, which is compounded by politicians’ desires to get in the news and claim credit for programs responding to public problems.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s03_p02">Competition between levels of federalism is a recurring feature of films and television programs. For instance, in the eternal television drama <em class="emphasis">Law and Order</em> and its offshoots, conflicts between local, state, and national law enforcement generate narrative tension and drama. This media frame does not consistently favor one side or the other. Sometimes, as in the film <em class="emphasis">The Fugitive</em> or stories about civil rights like <em class="emphasis">Mississippi Burning</em>, national law enforcement agencies take over from corrupt local authorities. Elsewhere, as in the action film <em class="emphasis">Die Hard</em>, national law enforcement is less competent than local or state police.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s04_p01">Under competitive federalism, funds go from national to state and local governments with many conditions—most notably, directives known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mandates</a><span class="glossdef">Directives from the national government to state and local governments, either as orders or as conditions on the use of national funds.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_037">This definition is drawn from Michael Fix and Daphne Kenyon, eds., <em class="emphasis">Coping with Mandates: What Are the Alternatives?</em> (Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press, 1988), 3–4.</span> State and local governments want national funds but resent conditions. They especially dislike “unfunded mandates,” according to which the national government directs them what to do but gives them no funds to do it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s04_p02">After the Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1994 elections, they passed a rule to bar unfunded mandates. If a member objects to an unfunded mandate, a majority must vote to waive the rule in order to pass it. This reform has had little impact: negative news attention to unfunded mandates is easily displaced by dramatic, personalized issues that cry out for action. For example, in 1996, the story of Megan Kanka, a young New Jersey girl killed by a released sex offender living in her neighborhood, gained huge news attention. The same Congress that outlawed unfunded mandates passed “Megan’s Law”—including an unfunded mandate ordering state and local law enforcement officers to compile lists of sex offenders and send them to a registry run by the national government.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_s04_p03">Federalism in the United States has changed over time from clear divisions of powers between national, state, and local governments in the early years of the republic to greater intermingling and cooperation as well as conflict and competition today. Causes of these changes include political actions, court decisions, responses to economic problems (e.g., depression), and social concerns (e.g., sin).</p>
