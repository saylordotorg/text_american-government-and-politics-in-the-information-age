    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_p02">The Constitution and its amendments outline distinct powers and tasks for national and state governments. Some of these constitutional provisions enhance the power of the national government; others boost the power of the states. Checks and balances protect each level of government against encroachment by the others.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">National Powers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">The Constitution gives the national government three types of power. In particular, Article I authorizes Congress to act in certain enumerated domains.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Exclusive Powers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p01">The Constitution gives <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exclusive powers</a><span class="glossdef">Powers that the Constitution grants to the national or state governments and prevents the other level from exercising.</span></span> to the national government that states may not exercise. These are foreign relations, the military, war and peace, trade across national and state borders, and the monetary system. States may not make treaties with other countries or with other states, issue money, levy duties on imports or exports, maintain a standing army or navy, or make war.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Concurrent Powers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p01">The Constitution accords some powers to the national government without barring them from the states. These <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concurrent powers</a><span class="glossdef">Powers that the Constitution specifies that either national or state governments may exercise.</span></span> include regulating elections, taxing and borrowing money, and establishing courts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p02">National and state governments both regulate commercial activity. In its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commerce clause</a><span class="glossdef">The section in the Constitution that gives Congress the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.”</span></span>, the Constitution gives the national government broad power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.” This clause allowed the federal government to establish a national highway system that traverses the states. A state may regulate any and all commerce that is entirely within its borders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p03">National and state governments alike make and enforce laws and choose their own leaders. They have their own constitutions and court systems. A state’s Supreme Court decision may be appealed to the US Supreme Court provided that it raises a “federal question,” such as an interpretation of the US Constitution or of national law.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s03_p01">The Constitution authorizes Congress to enact all laws “necessary and proper” to execute its enumerated powers.

        <h2 class="title editable block">States’ Powers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">The states existed before the Constitution, so the founders said little about their powers until the Tenth Amendment was added in 1791. It holds that “powers not delegated to the United States…nor prohibited by it [the Constitution] to the States, are reserved to the States…or to the people.” States maintain inherent powers that do not conflict with the Constitution. Notably, in the mid-nineteenth century, the Supreme Court recognized that states could exercise <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">police powers</a><span class="glossdef">Inherent powers that states hold to protect the public’s health, safety, order, and morals.</span></span> to protect the public’s health, safety, order, and morals.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_004">License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847).</span></p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reserved Powers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">Some powers are reserved to the states, such as ratifying proposed amendments to the Constitution and deciding how to elect Congress and the president. National officials are chosen by state elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p02">Congressional districts are drawn within states. Their boundaries are reset by state officials after the decennial census. So the party that controls a state’s legislature and governorship is able to manipulate districts in its favor. Republicans, having taken over many state governments in the 2010 elections, benefited from this opportunity.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">National Government’s Responsibilities to the States</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p01">The Constitution lists responsibilities the national government has to the states. The Constitution cannot be amended to deny the equal representation of each state in the Senate. A state’s borders cannot be altered without its consent. The national government must guarantee each state “a republican form of government” and defend any state, upon its request, from invasion or domestic upheaval.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">States’ Responsibilities to Each Other</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p01">Article IV lists responsibilities states have to each other: each state must give “full faith and credit” to acts of other states. For instance, a driver’s license issued by one state must be recognized as legal and binding by another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p02">No state may deny “privileges and immunities” to citizens of other states by refusing their fundamental rights. States can, however, deny benefits to out-of-staters if they do not involve fundamental rights. Courts have held that a state may require newly arrived residents to live in the state for a year before being eligible for in-state (thus lower) tuition for public universities, but may not force them to wait as long before being able to vote or receive medical care.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p03">Officials of one state must extradite persons upon request to another state where they are suspected of a crime.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p04">States dispute whether and how to meet these responsibilities. Conflicts sometimes are resolved by national authority. In 2003, several states wanted to try John Muhammad, accused of being the sniper who killed people in and around Washington, DC. The US attorney general, John Ashcroft, had to decide which jurisdiction would be first to put him on trial. Ashcroft, a proponent of capital punishment, chose the state with the toughest death-penalty law, Virginia.</p>

    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">“The Supreme Law of the Land” and Its Limits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p01">Article VI’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supremacy clause</a><span class="glossdef">The section in the Constitution that specifies that the Constitution and all national laws are “the supreme law of the land” and supersede any conflicting state or local laws.</span></span> holds that the Constitution and all national laws are “the supreme law of the land.” State judges and officials pledge to abide by the US Constitution. In any clash between national laws and state laws, the latter must give way. However, as we shall see, boundaries are fuzzy between the powers national and state governments may and may not wield. Implied powers of the national government, and those reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment, are unclear and contested. The Constitution leaves much about the relative powers of national and state governments to be shaped by day-to-day politics in which both levels have a strong voice.</p>

The states also have similar governmental structures to the national government: three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial (only Nebraska has a one chamber—unicameral—legislature). Otherwise, the states differ from each other in numerous ways. These include size, diversity of inhabitants, economic development, and levels of education. Differences in population are politically important as they are the basis of each state’s number of seats in the House of Representatives, over and above the minimum of one seat per state.</p>

During World War II, Native Americans working for the BIA organized to gain legal autonomy for tribes.
