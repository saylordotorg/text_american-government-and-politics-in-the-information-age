        <h2 class="title editable block">The Case against the Articles of Confederation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">The Articles could not address serious foreign threats. In the late 1780s, Britain denied American ships access to British ports in a trade war. Spain threatened to close the Mississippi River to American vessels. Pirates in the Mediterranean captured American ships and sailors and demanded ransom. The national government had few tools to carry out its assigned task of foreign policy.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_008">A synopsis is Jack N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">There was domestic ferment as well.

They appealed to state governments, where they faced resistance and even brief armed rebellions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Newspapers played up Shays’s Rebellion, an armed insurrection by debt-ridden farmers to prevent county courts from foreclosing mortgages on their farms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_010">See Leonard A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p06">Leaders who supported national government portrayed Shays’s Rebellion as a vivid symbol of state governments running wild and proof of the inability of the Articles of Confederation to protect financial interests. Ordinary Americans, who were experiencing a relatively prosperous time, were less concerned and did not see a need to eliminate the Articles.</p>

Instead, however, the Articles would be replaced by a new, far more powerful national government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p02">Twelve state legislatures sent delegates to Philadelphia (Rhode Island did not attend). Each delegation would cast a single vote.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p01">The delegates were not representative of the American people. They were well-educated property owners, many of them wealthy, who came mainly from prosperous seaboard cities, including Boston and New York. Most had served in the Continental Congress and were sensitive to the problems faced by the United States. Few delegates had political careers in the states, and so they were free to break with existing presumptions about how government should be organized in America.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p03">The Constitutional Convention was a mix of great and minor characters. Exalted figures and brilliant intellects sat among nonentities, drunkards, and nincompoops. The convention’s driving force and chief strategist was a young, bookish politician from Virginia named James Madison. He successfully pressured revered figures to attend the convention, such as George Washington, the commanding officer of the victorious American revolutionaries, and Benjamin Franklin, a man at the twilight of a remarkable career as printer, scientist, inventor, postmaster, philosopher, and diplomat.</p>

                <p class="para">The unassuming and slight James Madison made an unusual teammate for the dashing, aristocratic ex-soldier Alexander Hamilton and the august diplomat John Jay. But despite these contrasts and some political divides, they merged their voices in the Federalist papers, published in New York newspapers under the pseudonym “Publius.” Soon after the ratification of the Constitution, <em class="emphasis">The Federalist</em> was widely republished in book format. Scholars now regard it as the fullest explication of the logic underlying the Constitution.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p04">Madison drafted the first working proposal for a Constitution and took copious notes at the convention. Published after his death in 1836, they are the best historical source of the debates; they reveal the extraordinary political complexity of the deliberations and provide remarkable insight into what the founders had in mind.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_012">The standard edition of Madison’s notes is in <em class="emphasis">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</em>, ed. Max Farrand, 3 vols. (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1937).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p05">Once the Constitution was drafted, Madison helped write and publish a series of articles in a New York newspaper. These Federalist papers defend the political system the Constitutional Convention had crafted.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Interests and the Constitution</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p01">In the early twentieth century, historian Charles Beard asserted that the Constitution was “an economic document for economic ends,” pushed by investors and industrialists who would profit more from a national economic and political system than from one favoring small-scale agricultural interests.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_013">Charles A. Beard, <em class="emphasis">An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1913).</span> Research has not upheld Beard’s stark division of reaction to the Constitution into well-off supporters and poor, democratic adversaries. Many local, well-to-do patriarchs opposed the Constitution; many small merchants wanted a national government.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p02">But Beard’s focus on economic and social interests is revealing. Paper money, debt relief, and Shays’s Rebellion concerned those committed to existing economic and social orders. Consider Federalist No. 10, the most famous of Madison’s Federalist papers. In it, he decried the dangers of democracy; he started with “a rage for paper money” and “an abolition of debts,” then the specter of “an equal division of property,” all of which he found an “improper or wicked project.” Madison paid attention to the right to acquire and maintain property, which the Declaration brushed aside. He claimed that political systems were created to maintain liberty—including the liberty to accumulate wealth. Political equality meant only that each person had a right to express himself or herself.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s03_p01">The Constitutional Convention responded to ideas, not just interests. Delegates doubted that the people could wisely rule. They sought to replace <em class="emphasis">democracy</em> with a <em class="emphasis">republic</em>, in which officials would be chosen to act on the people’s behalf. Federalist No. 10 makes the case.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s03_p02">Madison was concerned with threats to order and stability from what he called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factions</a><span class="glossdef">James Madison’s term for groups that pursue their self-interest or individual preferences above the public good.</span></span>, groups pursuing their self-interest above the public good. For Madison, factions were inevitable. His worst nightmare was of a faction becoming a political majority, trampling on the rights of its helpless opponents, and quickly enacting its program. He favored a large republic, which, he believed, would discourage a faction’s rise to power. Madison expected that in a republic, the number of locally oriented interests would increase and diversify, which would make it harder for any one of them to dominate. Minority factions could pass legislation by forming temporary majorities, Madison reasoned, but these diverse majorities would not be able to agree on a single project long enough to be oppressive.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p01">Delegates to the Constitutional Convention first gathered on May 25, 1787, in what is now called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/inde/index.htm">Independence Hall in Philadelphia</a>. Their goal was to devise a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constitution</a><span class="glossdef">A system of fundamental laws and principles that prescribe the structure and functions of the government.</span></span>, a system of fundamental laws and principles outlining the nature and functions of the government. George Washington presided. Delegates worked in an intimate setting without committees. The structure of power created by the Constitution in Philadelphia resulted from a deeply political process.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_014">Political scientists have revealed the degree to which the Constitutional Convention and the ratification conventions can be understood to be the result of manipulation of parliamentary rules, strategic voting, shifting coalitions, and the “agenda-setting” and “framing” use of mass communication. Our analysis draws on these authors, especially John P. Roche, “The Founding Fathers: A Reform Caucus in Action,” <em class="emphasis">American Political Science Review</em> 55 (December 1961): 799–816; Calvin C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_p01">Deliberations took place in secret, as delegates did not want the press and the public to know the details of what they were considering (<a class="xref" href="#paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_n01">Note 2.16 "Comparing Content"</a>).

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_p02">Press coverage of the Constitutional Convention cannot be compared because one of the first decisions made in the Constitutional Convention was that “nothing spoken in the House be printed, or otherwise published or communicated.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_016">Max Farrand, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1937), vol. 1, 17.</span> The delegates feared that exposure through newspapers would complicate their work. The delegate who is today regarded as the great defender of civil liberties, George Mason, wrote to his son approvingly: “This I think myself a proper precaution to prevent mistakes and misrepresentation until the business shall have been completed, when the whole may have a very different complexion from that in the several crude and indigested parts might in their first shape appear if submitted to the public eye.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_017">Max Farrand, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1937), vol. 3, 28.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_p03">This gag rule was rigorously enforced. One day the presiding officer, George Washington, noticed that an inattentive delegate had dropped his notes on the floor when leaving the hall. Washington broke his usual silence and rebuked the unknown infractor: “I am sorry to find that some one Member of this Body, has been so neglectful of the secrets of the convention as to drop in the State House a copy of their proceedings, which by accident was picked up and delivered to me this morning. I must entreat Gentlemen to be more careful, least [sic] our transactions get into the News Papers, and disturb the public repose by premature speculations.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_p04">Throwing the notes on the table, Washington exclaimed, “I know not whose Paper it is, but there it is, let him who owns it take it.” Delegate William Pierce, who recorded this tale, noted that Washington “bowed, picked up his Hat, and quitted the room with a dignity so severe that every Person seemed alarmed.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_018">Max Farrand, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1937), vol. 3, 86–87.</span></p>

In August 1787, he wrote to his counterpart in London, John Adams, that there was no news from the convention: “I am sorry they began their deliberations by so abominable a precedent as that of tying up the tongues of their members. Nothing can justify this example but the innocence of their intentions, &amp; ignorance of the value of public discussions. I have no doubt that all their other measures will be good &amp; wise.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_019">Max Farrand, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1937), vol. 3, 76.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s01_p06">In 1787, the powers of the press were identified in ways we recognize in the twenty-first century. Washington was concerned that news about the political process might produce rumors, confusion, worry, and public opposition to worthwhile policies. But as Jefferson recognized, the news can also lead to productive public debate, dialogue, and deliberation.</p>

The central institution was a bicameral (two-chamber) legislature. The people would elect the lower house, which would in turn select the members of the upper house; the two chambers together would then elect the executive and judiciary. Breaking with the Articles of Confederation’s equal representation of states, the Virginia Plan allotted seats to both chambers of the legislature by population size alone.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_021">The text of the Virginia Plan (and its main rival, the New Jersey Plan) can be found in Clinton Rossiter, <em class="emphasis">1787: The Grand Convention</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1966), 361–63 and 369–71.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s03_p03">Cosmopolitan, centrally located states, provided strong initial support for the Virginia Plan against scattered opposition from border states. But Madison could not hold this coalition behind <em class="emphasis">both</em> a strong national government <em class="emphasis">and</em> a legislature allocated by population. Delegates from the small states of New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland liked a strong national government, but they feared being overpowered. Delegates from populous Massachusetts and three fast-growing Southern states joined the two largest states, Virginia and Pennsylvania, to support legislative districts based on population, but they disliked the Virginia Plan’s sweeping powers for the national government.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s03_p04">On June 15, the small states proposed an alternative. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">New Jersey Plan</a><span class="glossdef">The alternative to the Virginia Plan, offered by William Paterson of New Jersey, with reduced national powers and a single legislative body representing the states.</span></span> enhanced the national government’s powers to levy taxes and regulate commerce but left remaining powers to the states. The plan had a federal executive, elected by the legislature, to enforce states’ compliance with national law, and a federal judiciary to settle disputes among the states and between the states and the national government. Any national law would become “the supreme law of the respective States.” The New Jersey Plan preserved the core of the Articles of Confederation—equal representation of states in a unicameral (single-chamber) legislature.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_s03_p05">Only three states voted for the New Jersey Plan, but the Virginia Plan’s vulnerability was exposed. Facing an impasse, delegates from Connecticut suggested a compromise. Borrowing the Virginia Plan’s idea of a bicameral legislature, they proposed that one chamber, the House of Representatives, be made up of representatives from districts of equal population, while in the Senate each state would be equally represented with two senators.</p>

Southerners sought to maintain slavery, while New Englanders wanted national tariffs to protect their commerce.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_p02">Ratification was not easy to win. In most states, property qualifications for voting had broadened from landholding to taxpaying, thereby including most white men, many of whom benefited from the public policies of the states. Popular opinion for and against ratification was evenly split. In key states like Massachusetts and Virginia, observers thought the opposition was ahead.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_025">Jackson Turner Main, <em class="emphasis">The Antifederalists: Critics of the Constitution, 1781–1788</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1961), 249; Evelyn C.

They held to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, which favored a deliberately weak national government to enhance local and state self-government.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_026">See Herbert Storing, <em class="emphasis">What the Anti-Federalists Were For</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988).</span> They thought that the national government’s powers, the complex system of government, lengthy terms of office, and often indirect elections in the new Constitution distanced government from the people unacceptably.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p02">Opponents also feared that the strength of the proposed national government posed a threat to individual freedoms.

Most newspapers, especially those whose stories were reprinted by others, were based in port cities, if only because arriving ships provided good sources of news. Such locales were dominated by merchants who favored a national system to facilitate trade and commerce. Newspapers were less common in rural interior locations where Anti-Federalist support was greatest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_s03_p02">Federalists also pressured the few Anti-Federalist newspapers that existed. They wrote subscribers and advertisers and urged them to cancel. Anti-Federalist printers often moved to other cities, went out of business, or began reprinting Federalist articles. Federalists hailed such results as the voice of the people. When an Anti-Federalist paper in Philadelphia halted publication, Federalists exulted, “There cannot be a greater proof that the body of the people are federal, that the antifederal editors and printers fail of support.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn02_030">More specifically, see Robert A.

Massachusetts narrowly voted in favor of ratification, with the provision that the first Congress take up recommendations for amending the Constitution. New Hampshire, Virginia, and New York followed this same strategy. Once nine states had ratified it, the Constitution was approved. Madison was elected to the first Congress and proposed a Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Only after the Congress had approved the Bill of Rights did North Carolina and Rhode Island ratify the Constitution.</p>

In obtaining ratification of the Constitution, they adroitly outmaneuvered or placated their opponents. The eighteenth-century press was crucial to the Constitution’s success by keeping its proceedings secret and supporting ratification.</p>
