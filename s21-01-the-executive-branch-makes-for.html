        <h2 class="title editable block">The President</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s01_p01">Formal powers specified in the Constitution put the president at the center of foreign policy. They include being commander in chief of the armed forces, negotiating treaties, and appointing ambassadors. The president is also the spokesperson for and to the nation: notable presidential addresses have been made by Franklin D. Roosevelt after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and by George W. Bush following the 9/11 attacks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s01_p02">How presidents manage the bureaucracy influences the information they receive and their range of policy options.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn17_007">Gary R. Hess, <em class="emphasis">Presidential Decisions for War: Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf</em>. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001).</span> Franklin Roosevelt opted for overlapping jurisdictions, with departments competing for influence and his attention. Other presidents established rules and procedures for processing information and vetting opinions. President Clinton sought out independent-minded advisors and gave them some leeway to decide policy. President George W. Bush relied on a few advisors, particularly Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn17_008">Thomas Preston and Margaret G. Hermann, “Presidential Leadership Style and the Foreign Policy Advisory Process,” in <em class="emphasis">The Domestic Sources of American Foreign Policy</em>, 4th ed., ed. Eugene R.

        <h2 class="title editable block">National Security Advisor</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p01">Foremost among the president’s foreign policy advisors is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national security advisor</a><span class="glossdef">Leading advisor to the president on national security and foreign policy.</span></span>. Issues the advisor faces include how to serve and protect the president’s interests and how to deal with other makers of foreign and defense policy in the government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p02">Some <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/nsa">national security advisors</a> have built a large staff to help them formulate options and oversee policy implementation. They have been vocal in espousing and expressing their views. One of the most powerful and forceful national security advisors was Henry Kissinger, who served President Richard Nixon. He understood the job as requiring him to interact frequently with the media to communicate his and the president’s policy views. He was famously successful in dealing with reporters, especially the three television networks’ correspondents and the influential Washington columnists specializing in foreign affairs. He was able to “disarm them with his wit, intimidate them with his brilliance, flatter them with his confidences and charm them with his attention.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn17_009">Walter Isaacson, “The Senior Official,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Journalism Review</em> 14, no. 9 (November 1992): 30; see also Walter Isaacson, <em class="emphasis">Kissinger</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992).</span> His critics were likely to be telephoned, cajoled, stroked, invited to dine, and visited at their homes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p03">The national security advisor is often in competition with the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">secretary of state</a>. In the starkest example, President Jimmy Carter’s national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, clashed frequently with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. He tried to manage policy in the White House and did not always communicate decisions to other policymakers. Vance resigned in protest over not being informed in advance about the attempt to rescue the American embassy personnel held hostage in Iran in 1980.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p04">Some national security advisors try to be neutral facilitators in policy debates between the heads of the major foreign policy bureaucracies. They are not always successful. President Ronald Reagan’s national security advisors were unable to mediate between the constantly warring Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger or control Director of Central Intelligence William Casey.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p05">The trend in recent administrations has been to select knowledgeable and low-key individuals who can provide the president with expert advice but not invite or engage in running conflicts with the other foreign policy bureaucracies. Sometimes this turns into catering to the president’s wishes, as Condoleezza Rice did with President George W. Bush’s wish to go to war with Iraq. After his reelection in 2004, he appointed her secretary of state.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s02_p06">Led by the national security advisor, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/">National Security Council</a>’s Principals Committee consists of the president’s senior security advisors, relevant cabinet members, and military and intelligence advisors. The president’s principal forum for considering national security and foreign policies, it is supposed to ensure consensus on and coordinate the policies among the various government agencies. But it is not easy to avoid internecine warfare among its participants, and discourage (let alone prevent) the secretaries of defense and state and the vice president, as well as special envoys to trouble spots, from communicating to the president unilaterally to influence and make policy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The State Department</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s03_p01">The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> is the oldest cabinet-level department. It has primary responsibility for managing the foreign affairs budget and resources, leading and coordinating other US agencies in developing and implementing foreign policy, leading and coordinating US representation abroad, and negotiating with foreign countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s03_p02">In none of these areas is its leadership unchallenged. Within the United States, the national security advisor has often eclipsed the secretary of state and the State Department as the principal source of policy ideas. The Defense Department has long been a competitor in national security policy and the US Special Trade Representative provides an alternative source of economic advice for the president. Abroad, the ambassador’s authority in the US embassy is often resisted by personnel assigned to it by other agencies, such as those responsible for spying.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s03_p03">The State Department’s lead position in foreign affairs has also been compromised by congressional reluctance to pass foreign affairs appropriations, restrictions it imposes on how the funds can be spent, and micromanaging of the foreign affairs budget.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s03_p04">Congress also requires the State Department annually to certify countries as meeting targets on human rights, arms control, reducing drug trafficking, and other areas in order to remain eligible for foreign aid. An escape hatch does allow presidents to certify a country for aid if it is in the “national interest” to do so.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Defense Department</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04_p01">For most of its history, the military was organized under separate commands of the War Department and Navy Department. No political or military authority other than the president existed above these departments to coordinate and direct them. This changed after World War II, when the 1947 National Security Act established the cabinet-rank position of the secretary of defense. In 1949, an amendment to the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/NSChistory.htm">1947 National Security Act</a> established the Defense Department and the post of chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04_p02">Exercising command authority over the military on behalf of the president, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">secretary of defense</a> participates in making and executing foreign policy, especially when it requires the use of force. Thus Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was intimately involved in the decision to attack Iraq in 2002 and was responsible for the execution of the policy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04_p03">The chair of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jcs.mil/">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> plans and coordinates the deployment of American forces, the unified commands conduct these operations, and the military services train and equip the necessary forces. Since the 1980s, a dominant issue within the Defense Department has been improving the operational efficiency of the armed forces.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn17_010">Eliot A. Cohen, “A Revolution in Warfare,” <em class="emphasis">Foreign Affairs</em> 75 (1996): 37–54; and Thomas G. Mahnken and James R. FitzSimonds, “Revolutionary Ambivalence,” <em class="emphasis">International Security</em> 28 (2003): 112–48.</span> The concern for operational efficiency is joined by a concern for cost. Almost half of the Defense Department’s annual budget goes to salaries and a quarter to operating and maintaining military forces.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04_p04">The twin concerns for efficiency and cost have been combined in three debates over the ability of the United States to fight wars today. One debate is between defense hawks, who want increased defense spending to ensure US security, and deficit hawks, who wish to reduce all areas of government spending. A second debate is over military readiness. Does the military consist of “hollow forces” that look robust on paper but lack training, modern weapons, and effectiveness? The third debate is over the impact of modern technology on how the United States organizes, prepares for, and fights wars.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s04_p05">All three debates took place over the Iraq War. Deficit hawks reacted with great concern to the Bush administration’s continuously rising price tag for the war and the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. The second debate was seen in the concerns expressed by National Guard units over the length of time they were serving in Iraq and the refusal of the military to allow many career soldiers to leave, resign, or retire. The debate over the role of technology in warfare was central to the dispute between Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and many senior military officers over how to conduct the war and how large a military force was necessary.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Central Intelligence Agency</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s05_p01">The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) was created by the National Security Act of 1947. Its main task was to correlate, evaluate, and disseminate intelligence.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn17_011">John Ranelagh, <em class="emphasis">The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986); and Arthur S. Hulnick, <em class="emphasis">Fixing the Spy Machine: Preparing American Intelligence for the Twenty-First Century</em> (Westport, CT: Praeger,1999).</span> It was not explicitly authorized to engage in covert action or to collect its own information. Both of these tasks, however, quickly became part of its mission.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s05_p02">The CIA’s directorate for operations engages in covert operations. By the 1970s, the cumulative effect of two decades of covert action and of news stories about them produced a media and thus public image of the CIA as a “rogue elephant” that was out of control. Congress then created two special committees, one in each chamber, to oversee intelligence. It also insisted that covert actions be accompanied by an explicit “Presidential Finding” that the cover actions are in the national interest.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s05_s01_p03">After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the CIA’s intelligence estimating abilities and procedures came into question. Of concern was the absence of clandestine collection capabilities (spies) in many parts of the world that harbor anti-American terrorist movements or possess weapons of mass destruction. Also questioned was the CIA’s lack of cooperation with the FBI and other intelligence agencies. Perhaps most devastating was the finding of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.9/11commission.gov/">9/11 Commission</a> that investigated the terrorist attacks: “a failure of imagination” kept the intelligence agencies from anticipating and thwarting the attacks.</p>

At issue here was the quality of the intelligence that contributed to the decision to go to war and the failure to find evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Their supposed existence and the imminent threat posed by them to the United States had figured heavily in President Bush’s justification to Congress and the American people for the war.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch17_s01_s05_s02_p01">In response to intelligence failures, Congress passed and President Bush signed legislation creating a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dni.gov/">Director of National Intelligence</a> (DNI) in December 2004; the DNI was to be the president’s chief intelligence advisor, with substantial control over the government’s intelligence budget of approximately $40 billion.

Some observers are concerned that the combination of foreign policy and domestic missions in the same department limits its effectiveness. That is, the capacities to meet the challenges posed by earthquakes, floods, blackouts, and storms (tasks that are central to FEMA’s mission) have been underdeveloped as more resources and attention are given to fighting terrorism or that the need to respond to these catastrophes will divert attention away from fighting terrorism.</p>

The National Security Act of 1947 and recent bureaucratic reorganization after 9/11 reshaped the structure of foreign policymaking. Parties involved in making foreign policy often disagree over policies, military spending and military goals, and much more.</p>
