            <li>How do Americans affiliate with a political party?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s05_p02">People who identify with a political party either declare their allegiance by joining the party or show their support through regular party-line voting at the polls. People can easily switch their party affiliation or distance themselves from parties entirely. However, people who do not declare a partisan affiliation when they register to vote lose the opportunity to participate in primary election campaigns in many states.</p>

Regions of the country establish loyalties to a specific party as a result of the party’s handling of a war, a major social problem, or an economic crisis.

American parties realign about once every thirty or forty years. A critical election in 1932 brought the Democrats and President Franklin Roosevelt to power after a period of Republican domination dating from the 1890s. This New Deal coalition was based on an alliance of white Southerners and liberal Northerners who benefited from the social welfare policies of the Democratic administration during the Great Depression. The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 marked the beginning of a realignment favoring the Republicans. In this coalition, white Southerners moved away from the Democratic Party as they favored the more conservative values espoused by the Republicans.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_068">Walter Dean Burnham, “Realignment Lives: The 1994 Earthquake and Its Implications,” in <em class="emphasis">The Clinton Presidency: First Appraisals</em>, ed.

Mass media can contribute to partisan realignment by focusing attention on candidates’ personalities and scandals, which are short-term factors that can influence vote choice.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s05_s02_p04">People indicate their identification with a political party either by declaring their allegiance to a particular party or by regularly supporting that party at the polls. Societal groups that gravitate toward particular political parties can form partisan coalitions. These coalitions can shift during critical elections, which result in a minority party becoming the majority party in government.</p>
