        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s00_p01">A favorite pastime of political journalists is periodically assessing the state of political parties, usually in conjunction with national elections. Journalists are rarely optimistic or complimentary when describing parties’ present status or forecasting their future. However, history has shown that the Democratic and Republican parties are amazingly enduring institutions, even when the mass media have sold them short.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s00_p02">Reporters routinely take stock of the parties, and their prognosis is typically bleak and filled with foreboding. In 2003, <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> political reporter Adam Clymer took stock of the Democratic and Republican parties in a series of front-page articles. “With the Congress thinly divided along partisan lines, another presidential election taking shape, and the rules of campaign finance in limbo, the two national political parties are at crucial turning points,” he wrote. Clymer described a revitalized Republican Party that was looking forward to an era of political dominance after having had “one foot in the grave” for more than twenty years since the Watergate scandal in 1974. His prognosis for the Democratic Party was more pessimistic. Clymer quoted a Democratic Party leader as saying, “God knows we need help” and another who observed that his party had “run out of gas.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_001">Adam Clymer, “Buoyed by Resurgence, G.O.P. Strives for an Era of Dominance,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 25, 2003, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE1D91531F936A15756C0A9659C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE1D91531F936A15756C0A9659C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all</a>.</span> He argued that the Democrats lacked a unified message or a clear leader, and quoted a party activist: “Our party has so many disparate points of influence that we can never focus enough to achieve our programs.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_002">Adam Clymer, “Democrats Seek a Stronger Focus, and Money” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 26, 2003, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/26/us/democrats-seek-a-stronger-focus-and-money.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/26/us/democrats-seek-a-stronger-focus-and-money.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s00_p03">In hindsight, Clymer’s predictions are not entirely accurate, especially after the victory of Democratic president Barack Obama in 2008, and illustrate the pitfalls of speculating about the future of political parties. However, his observations raise important ideas about American parties. Political parties are enduring and adaptive institutions whose organization and functions change in response to different political and historical circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_003">Leon D. Epstein, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties in the American Mold</em> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1986).</span> The two major American political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, each have gone through periods of popularity, decline, and resurgence.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s00_p04">The Democratic and Republican parties have dominated for over 150 years because of their ability to adapt to changing political and cultural circumstances. In the early decades of the republic, when voting rights were limited to male landowners, parties formed around charismatic leaders such as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. When voting rights were extended, parties changed to accommodate the public. As immigrants came to the United States and settled in urban areas, party machines emerged and socialized the immigrants to politics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s00_p05">Parties also have adapted to changes in the media environment. When radio and television were new technologies, parties incorporated them into their strategies for reaching voters, including through advertising. More recently, the Republican and Democratic parties have advanced their use of the Internet and digital media for campaigning, fundraising, and issue advocacy.</p>

In the twentieth century, parties underwent waves of reform that some argue initiated a period of decline.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The founders of the Constitution were fearful of the rise of factions, groups in society that organize to advance a political agenda. They designed a government of checks and balances that would prevent any one group from becoming too influential. James Madison famously warned in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federalist No. 10</a><span class="glossdef">James Madison’s essay in the <em class="emphasis">Federalist Papers</em> that deals with the need to guard against the danger of factions whose interests might be at odds with those of the wider community.</span></span> of the “mischiefs of faction,” particularly a large majority that could seize control of government.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_007">Publius (James Madison), “The Federalist No. 10,” in <em class="emphasis">The Federalist</em>, ed.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Parties as Factions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p01">The first American party system had its origins in the period following the Revolutionary War. Despite Madison’s warning in Federalist No. 10, the first parties began as political factions. Upon taking office in 1789, President George Washington sought to create an “enlightened administration” devoid of political parties.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_011">John Kenneth White and Daniel M. Shea, <em class="emphasis">New Party Politics</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2000).</span> He appointed two political adversaries to his cabinet, Alexander Hamilton as treasury secretary and Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state, hoping that the two great minds could work together in the national interest. Washington’s vision of a government without parties, however, was short-lived.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p02">Hamilton and Jefferson differed radically in their approaches to rectifying the economic crisis that threatened the new nation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_012">Joseph Charles, <em class="emphasis">The Origins of the American Party System</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1956).</span> Hamilton proposed a series of measures, including a controversial tax on whiskey and the establishment of a national bank. He aimed to have the federal government assume the entire burden of the debts incurred by the states during the Revolutionary War. Jefferson, a Virginian who sided with local farmers, fought this proposition. He believed that moneyed business interests in the New England states stood to benefit from Hamilton’s plan. Hamilton assembled a group of powerful supporters to promote his plan, a group that eventually became the Federalist Party.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_013">Richard Hofstadter, <em class="emphasis">The Idea of a Party System</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">The Federalist Party originated at the national level but soon extended to the states, counties, and towns. Hamilton used business and military connections to build the party at the grassroots level, primarily in the Northeast. Because voting rights had been expanded during the Revolutionary War, the Federalists sought to attract voters to their party. They used their newfound organization for propagandizing and campaigning for candidates. They established several big-city newspapers to promote their cause, including the <em class="emphasis">Gazette of the United States</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Columbian Centinel</em>, and the <em class="emphasis">American Minerva</em>, which were supplemented by broadsheets in smaller locales. This partisan press initiated one of the key functions of political parties—articulating positions on issues and influencing public opinion.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_014">See William Nisbet Chambers, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties in a New Nation</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01">Political parties were first evident in presidential elections in 1796, when Federalist John Adams was barely victorious over Republican Thomas Jefferson. During the election of 1800, Republican and Federalist members of Congress met formally to nominate presidential candidates, a practice that was a precursor to the nominating conventions used today. As the head of state and leader of the Republicans, Jefferson established the American tradition of political parties as grassroots organizations that band together smaller groups representing various interests, run slates of candidates for office, and present issue platforms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_018">John Kenneth White and Daniel M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02">The early Federalist and Republican parties consisted largely of political officeholders. The Federalists not only lacked a mass membership base but also were unable to expand their reach beyond the monied classes. As a result, the Federalists ceased to be a force after the 1816 presidential election, when they received few votes. The Republican Party, bolstered by successful presidential candidates Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, was the sole surviving national party by 1820. Infighting soon caused the Republicans to cleave into warring factions: the National Republicans and the Democratic-Republicans.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_019">Ronald P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p03">Because party machines controlled the government, they were able to sponsor public works programs, such as roads, sewers, and construction projects, as well as social welfare initiatives, which endeared them to their followers.

            <p class="simpara">Boss Tweed Meets His Match</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p05">The lasting image of the political party boss as a corrupt and greedy fat cat was the product of a relentless campaign by American political cartoonist Thomas Nast in <em class="emphasis">Harper’s Weekly</em> from 1868 to 1871. Nast’s target was William “Boss” Tweed, leader of the New York Tammany Hall party machine, who controlled the local Democratic Party for nearly a decade.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p06">Nast established the political cartoon as a powerful force in shaping public opinion and the press as a mechanism for “throwing the rascals” out of government. His cartoons ingrained themselves in American memories because they were among the rare printed images available to a wide audience in a period when photographs had not yet appeared in newspapers or magazines, and when literacy rates were much lower than today. Nast’s skill at capturing political messages in pictures presented a legacy not just for today’s cartoonists but for photographers and television journalists. His skill also led to the undoing of Boss Tweed.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p07">Tweed and his gang of New York City politicians gained control of the local Democratic Party by utilizing the Society of Tammany (Tammany Hall), a fraternal organization, as a base. Through an extensive system of patronage whereby the city’s growing Irish immigrant population was assured employment in return for votes, the Tweed Ring was able to influence the outcome of elections and profit personally from contracts with the city. Tweed controlled all New York state and city Democratic Party nominations from 1860 to 1870. He used illegal means to force the election of a governor, a mayor, and the speaker of the assembly.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p08">The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, <em class="emphasis">Harper’s Weekly</em>, reform groups, and disgruntled Democrats campaigned vigorously against Tweed and his cronies in editorials and opinion pieces, but none was as successful as Nast’s cartoons in conveying the corrupt and greedy nature of the regime. Tweed reacted to Nast’s cartoon, “Who Stole the People’s Money,” by demanding of his supporters, “Stop them damned pictures. I don’t care what the papers write about me. My constituents can’t read. But, damn it, they can see pictures.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_028">Jonathan Kandall, “Boss,” <em class="emphasis">Smithsonian Magazine</em>, February 2002, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/boss.html">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/boss.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p01">Not everyone benefited from political machines. There were some problems that machines either could not or would not deal with. Industrialization and the rise of corporate giants created great disparities in wealth. Dangerous working conditions existed in urban factories and rural coal mines. Farmers faced falling prices for their products. Reformers blamed these conditions on party corruption and inefficiency. They alleged that party bosses were diverting funds that should be used to improve social conditions into their own pockets and keeping their incompetent friends in positions of power.</p>

The Progressives initiated reforms that lessened the parties’ hold over the electoral system. Voters had been required to cast color-coded ballots provided by the parties, which meant that their vote choice was not confidential. The Progressives succeeded by 1896 in having most states implement the secret ballot. The secret ballot is issued by the state and lists all parties and candidates. This system allows people to split their ticket when voting rather than requiring them to vote the party line. The Progressives also hoped to lessen machines’ control over the candidate selection process. They advocated a system of direct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary elections</a><span class="glossdef">An election that decides who will be a political party’s nominee for an office in the general election.</span></span> in which the public could participate rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">caucuses</a><span class="glossdef">Meetings held by party members to select candidates who will run for office.</span></span>, or meetings of party elites. The direct primary had been instituted in only a small number of states, such as Wisconsin, by the early years of the twentieth century. The widespread use of direct primaries to select presidential candidates did not occur until the 1970s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s01_p02">The Progressives sought to end party machine dominance by eliminating the patronage system.

The merit system, now called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil service</a><span class="glossdef">Government employment that would be awarded on the basis of qualifications rather than party loyalty.</span></span>, was instituted in 1883 with the passage of the Pendleton Act.

Whereas observers like the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>’s David Broder could write a book in 1972 with the title <em class="emphasis">The Party’s Over</em>, such eulogies were premature.

The two major political parties have been dominant for a long period of time. The parties are permeable, meaning that people are able to join or leave the party ranks freely.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p02">Some scholars contend that American parties have become more ideologically distinct over the last three decades. Party leaders are expressing polarized opinions on issues, especially at the national level. These differences can be seen in the highly partisan debate over the health-care system. Democrats in Congress support government involvement in the health-care system and worked to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act endorsed by President Obama in 2010. Republicans sought to repeal the act in 2011, arguing that it would cost people their jobs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Political parties in the United States are porous, decentralized institutions that can be joined readily by people who choose to adopt the party label, usually Democrat or Republican.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_044">Leon D.

Instead, party membership is very loosely defined often by state laws that are highly variable. In some states, citizens declare a party affiliation when registering to vote. People also can join a state or local party organization, or work for a candidate associated with a particular party.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Parties are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">umbrella organizations</a><span class="glossdef">Party organizations that accommodate a wide range of groups and interests.</span></span> that accommodate labor and business federations, interest groups, racial and ethnic constituencies, and religious organizations.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p03">The fact that groups seeking to achieve similar political goals are found in both parties is evidence of their permeability. Pro-choice and antiabortion forces exist within the two major parties, although the Democratic Party is far more accommodating to the pro-choice position while the Republican Party is overwhelmingly pro-life. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thewishlist.org">WISH List</a> is a group supporting pro-choice Republican candidates. The Democratic counterpart supporting pro-choice women candidates is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://emilyslist.org">Emily’s List</a>. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.democratsforlife.org">Democrats for Life of America</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rnclife.org">Republican National Coalition for Life</a> represent antiabortion constituencies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p04">Parties compete for the allegiances of the same groups in an effort to increase their bases of support. As the Latino population has swelled to over 35 million people, the Democratic and Republican parties have stepped up their efforts to attract Latino voters and organizations.

These major parties are ideologically ambiguous in that they take middle-of-the-road rather than extreme positions on issues. Parties are permeable institutions that allow people and groups to move easily in and out of their ranks. Rather than having strong ideological predispositions, American parties devise broad platforms to outline their stances on issues.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p02">National organizations are responsible for putting on the nominating conventions where presidential candidates are selected every four years.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p03">National parties adapted to the era of candidate-centered politics by becoming service-oriented organizations, providing resources for candidates and officeholders.

The DNC and the RNC have established multimedia strategies that include traditional mass media appeals through press releases and staged events. They also get their message out using sophisticated websites, Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, and YouTube channels. Party websites are a one-stop shop for information about candidates and officeholders, issue positions, and voting logistics. They also provide a gateway for people to become involved in politics by providing information about volunteer activities and offering opportunities to contribute to the party.</p>

There is fierce competition between parties in some states, while other states lean more favorably toward one party. Party competition, however, exists in every state.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p03">Like their national counterparts, state parties provide candidates with services, such as volunteer recruitment and polling. They offer citizens access to government leaders and information about issues.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p03">The party in government constitutes the organized partisans who serve in office, such as members of the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress. The president is the symbolic leader of his political party and can use this position to urge party members to achieve policy goals. Legislative parties seek to impose discipline on party members in Congress, which is not always easily accomplished because members represent vastly different constituencies with particular needs. Divided government—periods when the president is of a different party from the majority in Congress—can create challenges for presidents seeking to enact their policy agendas.</p>

Tea Party activists, such as former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, have lambasted the traditional news media for being tied to special interests and irrelevant for average Americans. Instead, Tea Party leaders have embraced social media, preferring to communicate with their supporters through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s06_s02_s04_p04">Early Tea Party protests against government economic policies received little mainstream press attention.

Stories by major news organizations focused on the evolution of the Tea Party, its positions on issues, its membership, and its most vocal spokespersons. Tea Party rallies garnered extensive attention from mainstream media as well as political bloggers. The Tea Party received the lion’s share of media coverage on election night in 2010, as the mainstream press framed the election results in terms of public dissatisfaction with the political status quo as evidenced by victories by Tea Party–backed candidates.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_084">Brian Stelter, “In News Coverage, Tea Party and Its ‘New Personalities’ Hold the Spotlight,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 3, 2010.</span></p>

CNN reports of a Tea Party protest in Chicago featured on-site reporters aggressively interviewing average citizens who were participating in the event, challenging them to defend the Tea Party’s positions on issues. CNN and network news outlets reported that members of Congress had accused Tea Party protestors of anti-Obama racism based on racially charged statements and signs held by some protestors. Fox News, on the other hand, assumed the role of Tea Party cheerleader. Fox analyst Tobin Smith took the stage at a Tea Party rally in Washington, DC, and encouraged the protestors.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s06_s03_p01">A minor-party candidate has never been elected president. In the past five decades, minor parties have held few seats in Congress or high-level state offices. Few minor party candidates have won against major-party candidates for governor, state representative, or county commissioner in the past two decades. Minor-party candidates have better luck in the approximately 65,000 nonpartisan contests for city and town offices and school boards in which no party labels appear on the ballot.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p01">Minor parties are hindered by laws that limit their ability to compete with major parties. Democrats and Republicans in office have created procedures and requirements that make it difficult for minor parties to be listed on ballots in many states. In Montana, Oklahoma, and several other states, a candidate must obtain the signatures of least 5 percent of registered voters to appear on the ballot. A presidential candidate must collect over one million signatures to be listed on the ballot in every state. This is an insurmountable barrier for most minor parties that lack established organizations in many states.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_093">Steven J. Rosenstone, Roy L.

The 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act and its amendments provide for public financing of presidential campaigns. Rarely has a minor-party candidate been able to qualify for federal campaign funds as the party’s candidates must receive 5 percent or more of the popular vote in the general election. Similar barriers hinder state-level minor-party candidates from receiving public funding for taxpayer-financed campaigns, although some states, such as Connecticut, are debating plans to rectify this situation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_p02">Political parties thrive when they are able to manage the media and effectively promote their candidates, leaders, and causes. Their goal is to use the media to publicize policy positions, activities, and leaders. Party organizations launch media blitzes and provide technical communications assistance to campaigns and government officials so that they can attract media attention. They also use media to inform and mobilize their loyalists. Media depictions tend to be dramatic, emphasizing infighting among party members as well as conflicts between different parties.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Interactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_p01">Political parties are obsessed with keeping their names and representatives in the public eye. Publicity gives the impression that the party is active and influential. A party with a strong media presence can attract volunteers and financial contributors. Parties use a variety of tactics in their efforts to control the media agenda and get their message out to the public and to journalists. They employ many of the same tactics as interest groups, such as holding news conferences, issuing press releases, giving interviews to journalists, and appearing on television and radio talk shows. Democratic and Republican officials provide competing commentary about issues. Party leaders participate in “spin sessions” to get their views heard. Parties engage in aggressive advertising campaigns. Finally, they maintain significant web and digital media presences to reach their supporters and to court the press.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Partisan Spin</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_s01_p01">Political parties seek to influence political debate on a daily basis by confronting the opposition in the media. They engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spin</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of providing an interpretation of events or issues that favors a particular side, such as the Democratic or Republican party.</span></span>, the practice of providing an interpretation of events or issues that favors their side. High-profile partisans make the rounds of political talk programs such as <em class="emphasis">Meet the Press</em>, and news shows and give interviews to print journalists to spin their views. Partisan spin doctors routinely appear on television immediately following candidate debates or major speeches to interpret what has been said and to recast any misstatements.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_099">Stephen Bates, <em class="emphasis">The Future of Presidential Debates</em> (Boston: Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, 1993).</span> Spin doctors can be elected leaders, party officials, or interest group leaders. In 2011, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan and Washington Governor Gary Locke provide opposing commentary on the State of the Union address by President Barack Obama. Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann gave the Tea Party spin on the address via webcast.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_s01_p02">Specific media outlets are associated with spin doctors who favor a specific party. Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh favors the Republican Party and draws a large audience. Liberal talk show hosts such as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow tend to support Democrats. The Fox News Network hosts spin doctors such as Bill O’Reilly, who calls his program a “no-spin zone” despite its constant promotion of Republican and conservative causes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_s02_p01">Political advertising is a way for parties to disseminate messages without having them filtered by journalists.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s01_s03_p01">Party websites offer a vast amount of information to average citizens, political activists, and journalists who take the initiative to visit them. Websites provide an effective mechanism for communicating information to citizens and can lessen the administrative burden on party organizations. They reach a large number of people instantaneously and have become more effective mechanisms for raising funds than the earlier method of direct mail. The sites include general political information, such as facts about American democracy and party history. Press releases, platforms, and position papers give the lowdown on issues and candidates. Party sites also host discussion boards and blogs where party elites, including candidates, interact with rank-and-file members.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_100">Rachael Gibson and Stephen Ward, “A Proposed Methodology for Studying the Function and Effectiveness of Party and Candidate Web Sites,” <em class="emphasis">Social Science Computer Review</em> 18: 301–19.</span> Websites hype symbols that create a sense of identity as well as a party brand. The technical delivery of this content is an important aspect of outreach, so developing e-mail lists of party members, especially visitors to the website, is a priority.</p>

In 2011, the Republican Party used its website to gain momentum for its quest to win the White House in 2012. Clicking on the link to the Republican National Committee site led directly to page featuring a negative ad against the Obama administration and the opportunity to “Help Fight Back” by donating money. The Democratic National Committee website, which represents the party of the sitting president, focuses heavily on the accomplishments of the Obama administration.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_p01">In depicting political parties, the media highlight conflicts between the two major parties and divisions within each party. The press also focuses on the strategies parties employ in their pursuit of political power.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Partisan Conflict</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s01_p01">Parties as adversaries is an accurate characterization of one of their primary functions, representing opposing viewpoints and providing platforms for debate. The modern party has been called “a fighting organization.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_101">Robert Michels, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties</em>, ed. Seymour Martin Lipset (1915; New York: Collier Books, 1962), 78.</span> Indeed, parties actively promote this image. Reporters consulting party websites and reading partisan blogs get their fill of negative hyperbole about the opposition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s01_p02">The press coverage can exaggerate the conflicts between parties by employing sports and war metaphors. Parties often are described as attacking, battling, fighting, jousting, beating, and pummeling one another. This type of media coverage becomes a problem when parties genuinely try to work together while the press continues to frame their relations in conflict terms. When the Republican congressional leadership held a meeting at the White House in 1995 and agreed to work with Democratic President Bill Clinton on public policy, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters that the meeting was “great.” When the press immediately speculated about when the cordial relations would break down, Gingrich reacted by dressing down reporters: “[Y]ou just heard the leaders of the Republican Party say that the Democratic President today had a wonderful meeting on behalf of America; we’re trying to work together. Couldn’t you try for twenty-four hours to have a positive, optimistic message as though it might work?”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_102">Joseph N.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Party Strategies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p01">Media depictions often focus on the strategies parties use to win elections and control government. The press is obsessed with how the Republicans and Democrats manage their messages to attract or lose supporters.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p02">One strategy typically portrayed by mass media is that parties routinely compromise the public good to achieve self-interested goals. The Democratic Party is continually criticized for catering to organized labor, Hollywood liberals such as Barbara Streisand and Alec Baldwin, and feminists. The Republican Party is chided for favoring conservatives and corporate interests. The press argues that both parties support these privileged groups because they make large financial donations to party organizations and campaigns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p03">Media depictions suggest that parties fail to live up to campaign promises about policies they will enact if their candidates are elected. A recurring media theme during President Obama’s presidency is that Obama has not represented his party’s interests, such as on the issue of tax cuts. However, press coverage is not consistent with research demonstrating that party leaders keep campaign promises at least two-thirds of the time.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_103">Joseph N.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Consequences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p01">Political parties have had to adapt to a dynamic mass media environment that at times has weakened their position in the political process. The introduction of television in the 1950s allowed candidates and government officials to circumvent parties and take their appeals directly to the public. An example is Nixon’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“Checkers” speech</a><span class="glossdef">A speech delivered by vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon during the 1952 presidential campaign. The speech was a defense against media reports that he had misused funds given to him by supporters.</span></span>. Richard Nixon, who was running on a ticket headed by Republican presidential candidate General Dwight D. Eisenhower, had been accused of taking money from campaign supporters. The Republican Party was unhappy with Nixon and considered dropping him from the ticket. To save his political career, Nixon went on television to make his case to the American people by detailing his personal finances and denying any wrongdoing. With his wife, Pat, by his side, Nixon declared that there was one gift from supporters he would not return, a dog named Checkers that had become a beloved family pet. The tactic worked as the public bought into Nixon’s impassioned television appeal. Eisenhower and Nixon went on to win the election.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p02">By the 1980s, party elites had less influence on public opinion than media elites, especially journalists.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_104">Nelson Polsby, <em class="emphasis">The Consequences of Party Reform</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983).</span> The press had assumed parties’ responsibility for recruiting candidates, organizing the issue agenda, and informing and mobilizing voters.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_105">Thomas E. Patterson, <em class="emphasis">Out of Order</em> (New York: Knopf, 1994).</span> Journalists controlled the amount of publicity parties and candidates received, which contributes to their recognition among voters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p03">Consultants work directly with candidates to develop media strategies, often leaving parties out of the loop. In his bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, former governor of Vermont Howard Dean worked with consultants to develop an innovative campaign strategy centered on using the Internet to build a base of online supporters through sites including Meetup.com and MoveOn.org, and to raise funds. The Democratic Party expressed concerns about Dean’s tactics because he ignored the traditional bases of the party’s support, such as environmental activists and other liberal interest groups.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_106">Thomas B. Edsall, “Dean Sparks Debate on His Potential to Remold Party,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, October 20, 2003.</span> Dean was successful in raising funds on the Internet but was unable to secure the presidential nomination.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p04">Parties responded in the 1990s by developing media strategies to enhance their proficiency as service providers to candidates, officeholders, and voters. They engaged in aggressive fundraising schemes so that they could afford to hire the services of consultants and purchase expensive advertising time on television and space in print publications. Parties have facilities where politicians do on-air television and radio interviews and tape messages for local media markets. They invest heavily in advertising during and between election cycles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p05">Today, major parties are at the forefront of innovation with communications technology as they seek ways of making the Internet and digital media more effective and exciting for party members. These media efforts have been paying off. Seventy-seven percent of the public believes that political parties are important to them for providing political information.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_107">James A.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p06">Political parties have a double-edged relationship with the media. On the one hand, the press is important for political parties because it publicizes the activities and positions of party organizations, leaders, and candidates, which can build a base of support. On the other hand, media coverage of parties emphasizes conflict and the failure of parties to make good on promises they make about policies. Thus parties are continually revising their strategies as they attempt to garner as much positive coverage and publicity as possible.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p07">Parties need to manage the media and attract sufficient attention to remain viable in the public eye and inform and mobilize their constituents. They interact with journalists by engaging in spin, producing and airing advertisements, hosting websites, and populating social media. Media depictions highlight the conflicts between parties and the strategies they employ to attract voters. Parties have adapted to a changing media environment by developing in-house media facilities to allow candidates and officeholders to communicate with constituents.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s07_s03_p08">Political parties provide a gateway to involvement in public affairs. Parties offer opportunities for taking part in political campaigns, advocating on behalf of a policy issue, and even running for office.
