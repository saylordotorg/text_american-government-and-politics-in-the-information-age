        <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_p01">After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_l01">
            <li>How do candidates present and use political advertising in their campaigns?</li>
            <li>How do candidates manage campaign debates? How do media influence debates?</li>
            <li>What is the nature of campaign media coverage? How do campaigns attempt to influence election coverage?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_p02">Campaigns want to influence media coverage in their candidate’s favor. They seek to dominate the election agenda, frame and prime issues, and have the media transmit their message of the day. The proliferation and diversity of modes of communication makes this complicated. Campaigns attempt to control their political advertisements and influence debates. They try to set the news-media agenda, but the relationship is uncertain at best.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_014">For an award-winning study of media in the 1992 presidential election, see Marion R. Just, Ann N. Crigler, Dean E. Alger, Timothy E. Cook, Montague Kern, and Darrell M. West, <em class="emphasis">Crosstalk: Citizens, Candidates, and the Media in a Presidential Campaign</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Political Advertisements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Television and radio advertisements are essential elements of election campaigns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_015">See Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, <em class="emphasis">The Spot</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992); and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, <em class="emphasis">Packaging the Presidency</em>, 3rd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).</span> Ads capitalize on people’s beliefs and values. They are often designed to arouse emotions, such as anxiety and fear, hope and enthusiasm.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_016">Ted Brader, <em class="emphasis">Campaigning for Hearts and Minds</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).</span> They attract attention with dramatic visuals, sounds, and slogans. They sometimes exaggerate, even distort, information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Candidate advertising in the information age has become more complex as campaigns seek to disseminate their ads through multiple platforms. Candidates release ads on candidate and political-party websites and on video-sharing platforms, such as YouTube and Hulu. Ads also are posted or linked on news sites and blogs.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Ad Formats</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Ads come in many formats, but even now when glitzy techniques are available, the talking head, in which the candidate speaks directly to the audience, is common. Other formats are testimonials from people enthusiastically supporting the candidate and documentary ads utilizing footage of the candidate campaigning. Ads that utilize a “self-incrimination” of the opponent can be devastating. In 1992, the Clinton campaign ran an effective ad juxtaposing President George H. W. Bush’s positive comments about the economy with data showing its decline.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p02">Ads can use a panoply of visual and sound techniques. Distance (tight close-ups can be unflattering), angles (camera shots that look up make an individual seem more powerful), movement (slow motion suggests criminality), editing (people looking at a candidate with adoration or disgust)—all these techniques influence viewers’ reactions. Color also influences perceptions: blue reassures, red threatens. Candidates often are shown in flattering color while the opponent is depicted in sinister black and white. Morphing, electronically changing and blending photographs and other visuals, can identify candidates with unpopular figures, such as Adolf Hitler.</p>

They also have been praised as “political multivitamins,” providing voters with pertinent and substantial evidence-backed information about policies they would otherwise not encounter. Attack ads can allow voters to contrast candidate’s qualifications and issue stance.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_018">See Michael M. Franz, Paul B. Freedman, Kenneth M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p02">Attack ads employ a number of techniques to convey their points. They can point out “flip-flops,” exposing apparent contradictions in the opponent’s voting record and public statements. They can chastise the opponent for “not being on the job” and missing votes. Ads can convey “guilt by association,” linking the opponent to unpopular individuals and organizations. Candidates can attempt to refute attack ads with denials, explanations, rebuttals, and apologies. However, many attack ads are effective in generating negative impressions of candidates. Rebuttals tend to repeat the original charge and prolong the ad’s visibility.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_019">Michael Pfau and Henry C.

                <p class="simpara">The Daisy Ad</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p03">The Daisy ad, an enduring attack ad, was designed for the 1964 election campaign of Democratic president Lyndon Johnson. It exploited the fear that Johnson’s Republican opponent, Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, was willing to use nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p04">The ad shows a little girl plucking the petals from a daisy as she counts down out of order from ten. A doomsday-sounding male voice takes over the countdown. At zero, there is a nuclear explosion, and the girl’s face turns into a mushroom cloud that fills the screen.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p05">Over the roar of the cloud, President Johnson intones, “These are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God’s children can live, or to go into the dark.” The word <em class="emphasis">stakes</em>, with its suggestion of being burnt at the stake, fits the Johnson campaign slogan, which ends the ad: “Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p06">The ad, which only ran once on television, never mentions Goldwater’s name. It was not necessary. People were soon informed by the news media that it referred to him. Outraged Republican leaders unintentionally publicized the ad, which only was aired once by the Johnson campaign. The news media replayed the ad, increasing its visibility and the negative effect it had on the Goldwater candidacy.</p>

The Daisy ad ran only once on television, but it gained tremendous notoriety through media coverage that proved detrimental to Goldwater.</p>

Predebate, they lower expectations about the debating skill of the candidate and raise them for the opponent. Campaign supporters try to convince journalists that their candidate won the debate. This spin is essential because journalists’ judgments, more than the substance of the debate, influence public opinion.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_021">Diana Owen, “The Debate Challenge,” in <em class="emphasis">Presidential Campaign Discourse</em>, ed.

They focus on “defining moments,” identifying memorable lines and gaffes. In his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976, President Gerald Ford, trying to make a statement about the spirit of the East Europeans, said that the Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe. Although people watching the debate registered little reaction, reporters picked up on this apparent blunder and hounded Ford for days.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Horse race coverage</a><span class="glossdef">News-media election coverage that emphasizes who is winning and losing the race.</span></span> focuses on which candidate is leading and which is trailing based on their standing in the polls, and it dominates campaign news. Coverage also focuses heavily on the campaign process and strategies, including the actions, decisions, and conflicts of the candidate’s staff. The press highlights candidates’ attacks on one another, as well as conflicts, controversies, blunders, and gaffes. Scandal, such as misconduct in office and illegal drug use, sometimes brought to reporters’ attention by a candidate’s opponents and spread on the Internet’s rumor mills, is a news staple.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_023">See Stephen J. Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter, <em class="emphasis">The Nightly News Nightmare: Television’s Coverage of U.S. Presidential Elections, 1988–2004</em>, 2nd ed. (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007) for an analysis and denunciation of the television news networks’ coverage of presidential elections.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p04">Coverage of policy issues in the news is slight, even in presidential elections. Candidates focus on only a few policy positions, which they repeat throughout the campaign. Journalists have little reason to report them frequently. Besides, policies lack the excitement and drama of the horse race.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p05">Candidates attempt to control their image, establish their campaign theme, and set the issue agenda through their campaign advertising. They design ads that will appeal to their supporters and reach out to undecided voters. Negative ads are prevalent in campaigns, as they can be effective in creating negative views of opponents and allowing voters to compare candidates.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p06">Debates allow voters to assess candidates one-on-one. Candidates seek to control debates by negotiating the logistics and engaging in intense preparation. Media engage in postdebate assessments of the candidates’ performances.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p07">News media focus heavily on the horse race and strategy elements of campaigns, especially who’s ahead and who’s behind in the polls. Candidate’s messages are conveyed in short sound bites. Journalists pay more attention to a candidate’s image, gaffes, and scandals than to issues.</p>
