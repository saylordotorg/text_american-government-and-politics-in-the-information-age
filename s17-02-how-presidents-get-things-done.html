    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p02">The political system was designed by the framers to be infrequently innovative, to act with neither efficiency nor dispatch. Authority is decentralized. Political parties are usually in conflict. Interests are diverse.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_021">George C. Edwards III, <em class="emphasis">The Strategic President: Persuasion and Opportunity in Presidential Leadership</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p03">Yet, as we have explained, presidents face high expectations for action. Adding to these expectations is the soaring rhetoric of their election campaigns. For example, candidate Obama promised to deal with the problems of the economy, unemployment, housing, health care, Iraq, Afghanistan, and much more.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p04">As we have also explained, presidents do not invariably or even often have the power to meet these expectations. Consider the economy. Because the government and media report the inflation and unemployment rates and the number of new jobs created (or not created), the public is consistently reminded of these measures when judging the president’s handling of the economy. And certainly the president does claim credit when the economy is doing well. Yet the president has far less control over the economy and these economic indicators than the media convey and many people believe.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p05">A president’s opportunities to influence public policies depend in part on the preceding administration and the political circumstances under which the new president takes office.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_022">Stephen Skowronek, <em class="emphasis">Presidential Leadership in Political Time</em> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2008).</span> Presidents often face intractable issues, encounter unpredictable events, have to make complex policy decisions, and are beset by scandals (policy, financial, sexual).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p06">Once in office, reality sinks in.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_p10">Presidents indicate what issues should garner most attention and action; they help set the policy agenda. They lobby Congress to pass their programs, often by campaign-like swings around the country. Their position as head of their political party enables them to keep or gain allies (and win reelection). Inside the executive branch, presidents make policies by well-publicized appointments and executive orders. They use their ceremonial position as head of state to get into the news and gain public approval, making it easier to persuade others to follow their lead.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Presidents try to set the political agenda. They call attention to issues and solutions, using constitutional powers such as calling Congress into session, recommending bills, and informing its members about the state of the union, as well as giving speeches and making news.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_024">Donna R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Congress does not always defer to and sometimes spurns the president’s agenda. Its members serve smaller, more distinct constituencies for different terms. When presidents hail from the same party as the majority of Congress members, they have more influence to ensure that their ideas receive serious attention on Capitol Hill. So presidents work hard to keep or increase the number of members of their party in Congress: raising funds for the party (and their own campaign), campaigning for candidates, and throwing weight (and money) in a primary election behind the strongest or their preferred candidate. Presidential coattails—where members of Congress are carried to victory by the winning presidential candidates—are increasingly short. Most legislators win by larger margins in their district than does the president. In the elections midway through the president’s term, the president’s party generally loses seats in Congress. In 2010, despite President Obama’s efforts, the Republicans gained a whopping sixty-three seats and took control of the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p03">Since presidents usually have less party support in Congress in the second halves of their terms, they most often expect that Congress will be more amenable to their initiatives in their first two years. But even then, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">divided government</a><span class="glossdef">A situation, increasingly common in recent years, where the presidency and at least one chamber of Congress are controlled by different parties.</span></span>, where one party controls the presidency and another party controls one or both chambers of Congress, has been common over the last fifty years. For presidents, the prospect of both a friendly House and Senate has become the exception.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p04">Even when the White House and Congress are controlled by the same party, as with President Obama and the 2009 and 2010 Congress, presidents do not monopolize the legislative agenda. Congressional leaders, especially of the opposing party, push other issues—if only to pressure or embarrass the president. Members of Congress have made campaign promises they want to keep despite the president’s policy preferences. Interest groups with pet projects crowd in.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p05">Nonetheless, presidents are better placed than any other individual to influence the legislative process. In particular, their high prominence in the news means that they have a powerful impact on what issues will—and will not—be considered in the political system as a whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p06">What about the contents of “the president’s agenda”? The president is but one player among many shaping it. The transition from election to inauguration is just over two months (Bush had less time because of the disputed 2000 Florida vote). Presidents are preoccupied first with naming a cabinet and White House staff. To build an agenda, presidents “borrow, steal, co-opt, redraft, rename, and modify any proposal that fits their policy goals.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_025">Paul C. Light, <em class="emphasis">The President’s Agenda: Domestic Policy Choice from Kennedy to Clinton</em>, 3rd ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 89.</span> Ideas largely come from fellow partisans outside the White House. Bills already introduced in Congress or programs proposed by the bureaucracy are handy. They have received discussion, study, and compromise that have built support. And presidents have more success getting borrowed legislation through Congress than policy proposals devised inside the White House.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_026">Andrew Rudalevige, <em class="emphasis">Managing the President’s Program: Presidential Leadership and Legislative Policy Formulation</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p07">Crises and unexpected events affect presidents’ agenda choices. Issues pursue presidents, especially through questions and stories of White House reporters, as much as presidents pursue issues. A hugely destructive hurricane on the Gulf Coast propels issues of emergency management, poverty, and reconstruction onto the policy agenda whether a president wants them there or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p08">Finally, many agenda items cannot be avoided. Presidents are charged by Congress with proposing an annual budget. Raw budget numbers represent serious policy choices. And there are ever more agenda items that never seem to get solved (e.g., energy, among many others).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Chief Lobbyist in Congress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01">After suggesting what Congress should do, presidents try to persuade legislators to follow through. But without a formal role, presidents are outsiders to the legislative process. They cannot introduce bills in Congress and must rely on members to do so.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Legislative Liaison</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p01">Presidents aim at legislative accomplishments by negotiating with legislators directly or through their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">legislative liaison</a><span class="glossdef">Now called the Office of Legislative Affairs, an office consisting of presidential staffers whose job is to interact with and lobby members of Congress.</span></span> officers: White House staffers assigned to deal with Congress who provide a conduit from president to Congress and back again. These staffers convey presidential preferences and pressure members of Congress; they also pass along members’ concerns to the White House. They count votes, line up coalitions, and suggest times for presidents to rally fellow party members. And they try to cut deals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p02">Legislative liaison focuses less on twisting arms than on maintaining “an era of good feelings” with Congress. Some favors are large: supporting an appropriation that benefits members’ constituencies; traveling to members’ home turf to help them raise funds for reelection; and appointing members’ cronies to high office. Others are small: inviting them up to the White House, where they can talk with reporters; sending them autographed photos or extra tickets for White House tours; and allowing them to announce grants. Presidents hope the cordiality will encourage legislators to return the favor when necessary.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_027">This section relies on Kenneth Collier, <em class="emphasis">Between the Branches: The White House Office of Legislative Affairs</em> (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1997).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p03">Such good feelings are tough to maintain when presidents and the opposition party espouse conflicting policies, especially when that party has a majority in one or both chambers of Congress or both sides adopt take-it-or-leave-it stances.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Veto</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p01">When Congress sends a bill to the White House, a president can return it with objections.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_028">This section relies most on Charles M. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Veto Bargaining: Presidents and the Politics of Negative Power</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000); see also Robert J. Spitzer, <em class="emphasis">The Presidential Veto: Touchstone of the American Presidency</em> (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988).</span> This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">veto</a><span class="glossdef">The president’s power to reject a bill by not signing it into law.</span></span>—Latin for “I forbid”—heightens the stakes. Congress can get its way only if it <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">overrides</a><span class="glossdef">The congressional power to enact legislation over a president’s veto by a two-thirds majority in each chamber.</span></span> the veto with two-thirds majorities in each chamber. Presidents who use the veto can block almost any bill they dislike; only around 4 percent of all vetoes have ever been successfully overridden.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_029">See Harold W. Stanley and Richard G. Niemi, <em class="emphasis">Vital Statistics on American Politics, 1999–2000</em> (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 1998), table 6-9.</span> The threat of a veto can be enough to get Congress to enact legislation that presidents prefer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p02">The veto does have drawbacks for presidents:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Vetoes alienate members of Congress who worked hard crafting a bill. So vetoes are most used as a last resort. After the 1974 elections, Republican President Ford faced an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress. A Ford legislative liaison officer recalled, “We never deliberately sat down and made the decision that we would veto sixty bills in two years.…It was the only alternative.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_030">Quoted in Paul C. Light, <em class="emphasis">The President’s Agenda: Domestic Policy Choice from Kennedy to Clinton</em>, 3rd ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 112.</span>
</li>
                <li>The veto is a blunt instrument. It is useless if Congress does not act on legislation in the first place. In his 1993 speech proposing health-care reform, President Clinton waved a pen and vowed to veto any bill that did not provide universal coverage. Such a threat meant nothing when Congress did not pass <em class="emphasis">any</em> reform. And unlike governors of most states, presidents lack a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">line-item veto</a><span class="glossdef">The power, available to most state governors but not to the president, to reject parts of a bill.</span></span>, which allows a chief executive to reject parts of a bill. Congress sought to give the president this power in the late 1990s, but the Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_031">Clinton v. City of New York, 524 US 427 (1998).</span> Presidents must take or leave bills in their totality.</li>
                <li>Congress can turn the veto against presidents. For example, it can pass a popular bill—especially in an election year—and dare the president to reject it. President Clinton faced such “veto bait” from the Republican Congress when he was up for reelection in 1996. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR.">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, which would have restricted federal recognition of marriage to opposite-sex couples, was deeply distasteful to lesbians and gay men (a key Democratic constituency) but strongly backed in public opinion polls. A Clinton veto could bring blame for killing the bill or provoke a humiliating override. Signing it ran the risk of infuriating lesbian and gay voters. Clinton ultimately signed the legislation—in the middle of the night with no cameras present.</li>
                <li>Veto threats can backfire. After the Democrats took over the Senate in mid-2001, they moved the “patients’ bill of rights” authorizing lawsuits against health maintenance organizations to the top of the Senate agenda. President Bush said he would veto the bill unless it incorporated strict limits on rights to sue and low caps on damages won in lawsuits. Such a visible threat encouraged a public perception that Bush was opposed to any patients’ bill of rights, or even to patients’ rights at all.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_032">Frank Bruni, “Bush Strikes a Positive Tone on a Patients’ Bill of Rights,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 10, 2001, A12.</span> Veto threats thus can be ineffective or create political damage (or, as in this case, both).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p03">Savvy presidents use “vetoes not only to block legislation but to shape it.…Vetoes are not fatal bullets but bargaining ploys.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_033">Charles M. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Veto Bargaining: Presidents and the Politics of Negative Power</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 171.</span> Veto threats and vetoing ceremonies become key to presidential communications in the news, which welcomes the story of Capitol Hill-versus-White House disputes, particularly under divided government. In 1996, President Clinton faced a tough welfare reform bill from a Republican Congress whose leaders dared him to veto the bill so they could claim he broke his 1992 promise to “end welfare as we know it.” Clinton vetoed the first bill; Republicans reduced the cuts but kept tough provisions denying benefits to children born to welfare recipients. Clinton vetoed this second version; Republicans shrank the cuts again and reduced the impact on children. Finally, Clinton signed the bill—and ran ads during his reelection campaign proclaiming how <em class="emphasis">he</em> had “ended welfare as we know it.”</p>

This practice was uncommon until developed during President Ronald Reagan’s second term. It escalated under President George W. Bush, who rarely exercised the veto but instead issued almost 1,200 signing statements in eight years—about twice as many as all his predecessors combined. As one example, he rejected the requirement that he report to Congress on how he had provided safeguards against political interference in federally funded research. He justified his statements on the “inherent” power of the commander in chief and on a hitherto obscure doctrine called the unitary executive, which holds that the executive branch can overrule Congress and the courts on the basis of the president’s interpretation of the Constitution.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s03_p02">President Obama ordered executive officials to consult with the attorney general before relying on any of President Bush’s signing statements to bypass a law. Yet he initially issued some signing statements himself. Then, to avoid clashing with Congress, he refrained from doing so. He did claim that the executive branch could bypass what he deemed to be unconstitutional restraints on executive power. But he did not invoke the unitary executive theory.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_034">Charlie Savage, “Obama’s Embrace of a Bush Tactic Riles Congress,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, August 9, 2009, A1; and Charlie Savage, “Obama Takes a New Route to Opposing Parts of Laws,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 9, 2010, A9.</span></p>

Divided government and party polarization on Capitol Hill have made Congress more willing to disagree with the president. So recent presidents are less successful even while being choosier about bills to endorse. Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson staked out positions on well over half of congressional roll call votes. Their successors have taken positions on fewer than one-fourth of them—especially when their party did not control Congress. “Presidents, wary of an increasingly independent-minded congressional membership, have come to actively support legislation only when it is of particular importance to them, in an attempt to minimize defeat.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_037">Lyn Ragsdale, <em class="emphasis">Vital Statistics on the Presidency</em>, 3rd ed.

Courts treat them as equivalent to laws. Dramatic events have resulted from executive orders. Some famous executive orders include Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s closing the banks to avoid runs on deposits and his authorizing internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, Truman’s desegregation of the armed forces, Kennedy’s establishment of the Peace Corps, and Nixon’s creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. More typically, executive orders reorganize the executive branch and impose restrictions or directives on what bureaucrats may or may not do. The attraction of executive orders was captured by one aide to President Clinton: “Stroke of the pen. Law of the land. Kind of cool.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_048">Paul Begala, quoted in James Bennet, “True to Form, Clinton Shifts Energies Back to U.S. Focus,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 5, 1998, 10.</span> Related ways for presidents to try to get things done are by memoranda to cabinet officers, proclamations authorized by legislation, and (usually secret) national security directives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_049">Phillip J. Cooper, <em class="emphasis">By Order of the President: The Use and Abuse of Executive Direct Action</em> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2002).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s02_p03">Executive orders are imperfect for presidents; they can be easily overturned. One president can do something “with the stroke of a pen”; the next can easily undo it. President Reagan’s executive order withholding American aid to international population control agencies that provide abortion counseling was rescinded by an executive order by President Clinton in 1993, then reinstated by another executive order by President Bush in 2001—and rescinded once more by President Obama in 2009. Moreover, since executive orders are supposed to be a mere execution of what Congress has already decided, they can be superseded by congressional action.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s03_p01">Opportunities to act on behalf of the entire nation in international affairs are irresistible to presidents. Presidents almost always gravitate toward foreign policy as their terms progress. Domestic policy wonk Bill Clinton metamorphosed into a foreign policy enthusiast from 1993 to 2001. Even prior to 9/11 the notoriously untraveled George W. Bush was undergoing the same transformation. President Obama has been just as if not more involved in foreign policy than his predecessors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s03_p02">Congress—as long as it is consulted—is less inclined to challenge presidential initiatives in foreign policy than in domestic policy. This idea that the president has greater autonomy in foreign than domestic policy is known as the “Two Presidencies Thesis.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_050">See Barbara Hinckley, <em class="emphasis">Less than Meets the Eye: Foreign Policy Making and the Myth of the Assertive Congress</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994).

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s03_p03">War powers provide another key avenue for presidents to act unilaterally. After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush’s Office of Legal Counsel to the US Department of Justice argued that as commander in chief President Bush could do what was necessary to protect the American people.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_051">John Yoo, <em class="emphasis">The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s03_p04">Since World War II, presidents have never asked Congress for (or received) a declaration of war. Instead, they rely on open-ended congressional authorizations to use force (such as for wars in Vietnam and “against terrorism”), United Nations resolutions (wars in Korea and the Persian Gulf), North American Treaty Organization (NATO) actions (peacekeeping operations and war in the former Yugoslavia), and orchestrated requests from tiny international organizations like the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (invasion of Grenada). Sometimes, presidents amass all these: in his last press conference before the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, President Bush invoked the congressional authorization of force, UN resolutions, <em class="emphasis">and</em> the inherent power of the president to protect the United States derived from his oath of office.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_s03_p05">Congress can react against undeclared wars by cutting funds for military interventions. Such efforts are time consuming and not in place until long after the initial incursion. But congressional action, or its threat, did prevent military intervention in Southeast Asia during the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 and sped up the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon in the mid-1980s and Somalia in 1993.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_052">William G.

It established that presidents must consult with Congress prior to a foreign commitment of troops, must report to Congress within forty-eight hours of the introduction of armed forces, and must withdraw such troops after sixty days if Congress does not approve. All presidents denounce this legislation. But it gives them the right to commit troops for sixty days with little more than requirements to consult and report—conditions presidents often feel free to ignore. And the presidential prerogative under the War Powers Act to commit troops on a short-term basis means that Congress often reacts after the fact. Since Vietnam, the act has done little to prevent presidents from unilaterally launching invasions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_053">Louis Fisher, <em class="emphasis">Presidential War Power</em> (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1995); Barbara Hinckley, <em class="emphasis">Less than Meets the Eye: Foreign Policy Making and the Myth of the Assertive Congress</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), chap. 4.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_s01_p01">For over fifty years, pollsters have asked survey respondents, “Do you approve or disapprove of the way that the president is handling his job?” Over time there has been variation from one president to the next, but the general pattern is unmistakable.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_056">James A.

Brody, <em class="emphasis">Assessing the President: The Media, Elite Opinion, and Public Support</em> (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991).</span> Approval starts out fairly high (near the percentage of the popular vote), increases slightly during the honeymoon, fades over the term, and then levels off. Presidents differ largely in the <em class="emphasis">rate</em> at which their approval rating declines. President Kennedy’s support eroded only slightly, as opposed to the devastating drops experienced by Ford and Carter. Presidents in their first terms are well aware that, if they fall below 50 percent, they are in danger of losing reelection or of losing allies in Congress in the midterm elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_s01_p02">Events during a president’s term—and how the news media frame them—drive approval ratings up or down. Depictions of economic hard times, drawn-out military engagements (e.g., Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq), unpopular decisions (e.g., Ford’s pardon of Nixon), and other bad news drag approval ratings lower. The main upward push comes from quick international interventions, as for President Obama after the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, or successfully addressing national emergencies, which boost a president’s approval for several months. Under such conditions, official Washington speaks more in one voice than usual, the media drop their criticism as a result, and presidents depict themselves as embodiments of a united America. The successful war against Iraq in 1991 pushed approval ratings for the elder Bush to 90 percent, exceeded only by the ratings of his son after 9/11. It may be beside the point whether the president’s decision was smart or a blunder. Kennedy’s press secretary, Pierre Salinger, later recalled how the president’s approval ratings actually climbed after Kennedy backed a failed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs: “He called me into his office and he said, ‘Did you see that Gallup poll today?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Do you think I have to continue doing stupid things like that to remain popular with the American people?’”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_057">Quoted in Daniel C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_s01_p03">But as a crisis subsides, so too do official unity, tributes in the press, and the president’s lofty approval ratings. Short-term effects wane over the course of time. Bush’s huge boost from 9/11 lasted well into early 2003; he got a smaller, shorter lift from the invasion of Iraq in April 2003 and another from the capture of Saddam Hussein in December before dropping to levels perilously near, then below, 50 percent. Narrowly reelected in 2008, Bush saw his approval sink to new lows (around 30 percent) over the course of his second term.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_s02_p02">After the devastating loss of Congress to the Republicans midway through his first term, President Clinton hired public relations consultant Dick Morris to find widely popular issues on which he could take a stand. Morris used a “60 percent rule”: if six out of ten Americans were in favor of something, Clinton had to be too. Thus the Clinton White House crafted and adopted some policies knowing that they had broad popular support, such as balancing the budget and “reforming” welfare.</p>

Polls can identify the words and phrases that best sell policies to people. President George W. Bush referred to “school choice” instead of “school voucher programs,” to the “death tax” instead of “inheritance taxes,” and to “wealth-generating private accounts” rather than “the privatization of Social Security.” He presented reducing taxes for wealthy Americans as a “jobs” package.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn13_059">Joshua Green, “The Other War Room,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Monthly</em> 34, no. 4 (April 2002): 11–16; and Ben Fritz, Bryan Keefer, and Brendan Nyhan, <em class="emphasis">All the President’s Spin: George W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch13_s02_s05_p06">Memorable settings may be chosen as backdrops for speeches, but they can backfire. On May 1, 2003, President Bush emerged in a flight suit from a plane just landed on the aircraft carrier USS <em class="emphasis">Abraham Lincoln</em> and spoke in front of a huge banner that proclaimed “Mission Accomplished,” implying the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The banner was positioned for the television cameras to ensure that the open sea, not San Diego, appeared in the background. The slogan may have originated with the ship’s commander or sailors, but the Bush people designed and placed it perfectly for the cameras and choreographed the scene.</p>

To what extent he can lead Congress depends on its party composition and ideological makeup. As the chief executive, the president gets things done through the appointment powers, executive orders, and war powers. The president seeks power and public approval through speeches and by heeding public response to polls.</p>
