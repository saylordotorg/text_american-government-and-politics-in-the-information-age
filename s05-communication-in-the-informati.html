    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00_p01">On the evening of April 2, 2003, the television networks’ nightly news aired a brief night-vision video, supplied by the Defense Department, of US forces carrying Private Jessica Lynch to safety after rescuing her from behind enemy lines in Iraq. The next day, in an exclusive on its front page that read like a Hollywood screenplay outline, the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reported her heroic story. Written from Washington, DC, and based on information supplied by unnamed officials, it told how, after “fighting to the death” and shooting several enemy soldiers, the young maintenance clerk was seriously wounded, captured, and taken to an enemy hospital. A few days later she was daringly rescued by US commandos.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_001">Susan Schmidt and Vernon Loeb, “‘She Was Fighting to the Death’; Details Emerging of W. V. Soldier’s Capture and Rescue,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, April 3, 2003, A1.</span> The story echoed through the broadcasting and print news media in the United States, throughout the world, and on the web. The television networks’ morning news shows sent reporters to West Virginia to interview Lynch’s family and friends. A <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.Jessica-Lynch.com">website</a> was established to receive and share tributes to her gallantry and feats.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_002">Scott Drake, webmaster of Jessica-Lynch.com, e-mail to Tim Cook, March 6, 2005.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00_p02">Although the <em class="emphasis">Post</em>’s report mentioned that the story had yet to be confirmed, the Pentagon reaped favorable publicity for the war with this tale of a Rambo-type exploit by an ordinary American girl in the battle against tyranny. This frame, or point of view, was widely used in many accounts of the event. (We explain frames and framing in detail in the section “Media Influences on Politics, Government, and Public Policies” in <a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03#paletz_1.0-ch01_s03">Section 1.3 "Opinion and Commentary"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00_p03">Media companies bargained for the rights to Private Lynch’s story. Viacom offered her a package: a prime-time news interview on its CBS television network; a book deal with its publishing house, Simon and Schuster; a music-video host spot on its cable channel MTV2; and a movie contract.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_003">Jim Rutenberg, “To Interview Former P.O.W., CBS Offers Stardom,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 16, 2003, A1.</span> Eventually she signed with NBC, which had indicated that it was going to make a TV movie about her whether it had the rights to her story or not. NBC aired its made-for-TV movie <em class="emphasis">Saving Jessica Lynch</em> soon after the Veteran’s Day publication of a book about her ordeal written by a former <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reporter with whom she split a $1 million advance.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_004">Rick Bragg, <em class="emphasis">I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story</em> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003).</span> Promoting the book, Ms. Lynch appeared on ABC’s <em class="emphasis">Primetime Live</em> for an interview with Diane Sawyer, NBC’s <em class="emphasis">Today Show</em>, the CBS <em class="emphasis">Late Show</em> with David Letterman, and on CNN’s <em class="emphasis">Larry King Live</em>. She was the subject of a cover story in <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine and was featured in <em class="emphasis">Glamour</em> magazine as one of its women of the year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00_p04">Accounts in both mass and new media, statements by Private Lynch herself, and a commentary by the <em class="emphasis">Post</em>’s ombudsman (the individual at the newspaper charged with evaluating its stories) almost three months after the original story, indicated that the facts, to the extent they could be verified, were far less heroic.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_005">Dana Priest, William Booth, and Susan Schmidt, “A Broken Body, a Broken Story, Pieced Together…,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, June 17, 2003, A1 and Michael Getler, “A Long, and Incomplete, Correction,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, June 29, 2003, B6.</span> Lynch’s gun had jammed and not been fired. She did not fight or shoot at any enemy soldiers. The rescue may not have been necessary because the Iraqi army had fled from the hospital the previous day, although it probably still controlled the town. Hospital staff had escorted the commandos to her ward. Blogs dissecting and arguing about the media’s rethinking mushroomed. Over two years after the initial event, a former deputy commander at the United States Central Command wrote an op-ed column in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reminding people that Private Lynch had never claimed to be a hero and denying that the military had played up her rescue for its publicity purposes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_006">Michael DeLong, “Politics During Wartime,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 27, 2007, A7.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s00_p05">The Jessica Lynch story graphically reveals the interconnection of communication, information, and the media, as well as their significance for government and politics. These are the subjects of this chapter.</p>

We define it broadly to encompass entertainment, news, opinion, and commentary.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_p04">The bulk of information that Americans obtain about politics and government comes through the mass and new media. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mass media</a><span class="glossdef">Well-established communication formats, such as newspapers and magazines, network television and radio stations, designed to reach large audiences.</span></span> are well-established communication formats, such as newspapers and magazines, network television and radio stations, designed to reach large audiences.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_p06">The media, old and new, are central to American politics and government in three ways that we highlight throughout this book. First, they depict the people, institutions, processes, issues, and policies involved in politics and government. Second, the way in which participants in government and politics interact with the media influences the way in which the media depict them. Third, the media’s depictions can have effects.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Economics, Government and Politics, and Technology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Three interrelated factors are central to the development of the US media industry and its political contents. They are economics, government and politics, and technology.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">We start with economics. Journalist A. J. Liebling wrote, “The function of the press…is to inform, but its role is to make money.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_008">A. J. Liebling, <em class="emphasis">The Press</em> (New York: Ballantine, 1964), 7.</span> Even when profit is not the motive, the media need financing to survive. The commercial media rely on advertising, sales, and subscriptions, and so the content of their diverse products is aimed at attracting audiences desirable to advertisers. Unlike other countries, the United States has no media primarily financed by government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Government is involved with the media as a regulator, censor, and enabler. Regulation often involves decisions on technology: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has given away approximately $70 billion worth of digital spectrum, the wireless airwaves that carry television and radio broadcasts, to major media companies. Government censors by restricting content it deems obscene or by punishing media for producing such content. Government enables when, for example, it waives the antitrust laws for media companies or subsidizes and thus lowers the postage costs for mailing newspapers and magazines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">Technological innovation can change media economics, relations with politicians and government, and the media’s political contents. Thus the development of television made it easier for candidates to communicate directly with voters and temporarily reduced the importance of political parties in elections.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">Economics, government, and technology interact. The degree to which a technology influences politics depends on the way in which the technology is used. This in turn is shaped by the economic realities of the marketplace and by government policies concerning who can use a medium and for what purpose. Although the technology of television, even before cable, could have allowed for multiple and diverse channels, the economic search for a big audience to attract advertising revenue, paired with government regulation that favored private for-profit ownership, created the “three-network system” that endured until the 1980s. This system provided airtime for presidents to present their programs to a huge national audience. When cable television offered more alternatives for viewers, it became harder for presidents to be heard above the clamor of competing programs—a difficulty furthered by the emergence of new media.</p>

    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Media Industry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">A few multinational conglomerates dominate the mass media; indeed, they are global media empires. Between them, they own the main television networks and production companies, most of the popular cable channels, the major movie studios, magazines, book publishers, and the top recording companies, and they have significant ownership interests in Internet media. Other large corporations own the vast majority of newspapers, major magazines, television and radio stations, and cable systems. Many people live in places that have one newspaper, one cable-system owner, few radio formats, and one bookstore selling mainly best sellers.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_009">C. Edwin Baker argues for the importance of media diversity in <em class="emphasis">Media Concentration and Democracy: Why Ownership Matters</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007).</span> Furthering consolidation, in January 2011 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the merger of Comcast, the nation’s largest cable and home Internet provider, with NBC Universal, one of the major producers of television shows and movies and the owner of several local stations as well as such lucrative cable channels as MSNBC, CNBC, USA, Bravo, and SyFy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p02">Some scholars criticize the media industry for pursuing profits and focusing on the bottom line. They accuse it of failing to cover government and public affairs in depth and of not presenting a wide range of views on policy issues.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_010">Ben H. Bagdikian, <em class="emphasis">The New Media Monopoly</em> (Boston: Beacon Press, 2004).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p03">The reliance of most of the mass media on advertising as their main source of revenue and profit can discourage them from giving prominence to challenging social and political issues and critical views. Advertisers usually want cheery contexts for their messages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Nonetheless, the mass media contain abundant information about politics, government, and public policies. Here is the essential information about the main types of mass media and their political contents.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Newspapers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p01">The core of the mass media of the departed twentieth century was the newspaper. Even now, newspapers originate the overwhelming majority of domestic and foreign news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p02">During recent years, sales have plummeted as many people have given up or, as with the young, never acquired the newspaper habit. Further cutting into sales are newspapers’ free online versions. Revenue from advertising (automotive, employment, and real estate) has also drastically declined, with classified ads moving to Craigslist and specialist job-search sites. As a result, newspapers have slashed staff, closed foreign and domestic bureaus (including in Washington, DC), reduced reporting, and shrunk in size.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p03">Nonetheless, there are still around 1,400 daily newspapers in the United States with estimated combined daily circulations of roughly forty million; many more millions read the news online. Chains of newspapers owned by corporations account for over 80 percent of circulation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p04">A few newspapers, notably the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> (2.1 million), <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> (1.8 million), and the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> (877,000), are available nationwide.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p05">The <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, although it has erected a pay wall around its Internet content, claims an electronic readership of 450,000. Its success suggests that in the future some newspapers may go completely online—thus reducing much of their production and distribution costs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p06">Most newspapers, including thousands of weeklies, are aimed at local communities. But after losing advertising revenue, their coverage is less comprehensive. They are being challenged by digital versions of local newspapers, such as AOL’s Patch.com.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_011">Verne G. Kopytoff, “AOL Bets on Hyperlocal News, Finding Progress Where Many Have Failed,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 17, 2011, B3.</span> It has seven hundred sites, each in an affluent community, in nineteen states and the District of Columbia. AOL has hired journalists and equipped each of them with a laptop computer, digital camera, cell phone, and police scanner to publish up to five items of community news daily. Some of their stories have achieved prominence, as, for example, a 2009 report about the hazing of high school freshmen in Millburn, New Jersey. But the most popular posts are about the police, schools, and local sports; and “often the sites are like digital Yellow Pages.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_012">Ken Auletta, “You’ve Got News,” <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, January 24, 2011, 33.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Magazines</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p01">There are roughly five thousand magazines published on every conceivable subject. Five publishers account for around one-third of the total revenue generated. Political and social issues are commonly covered in news weeklies such as <em class="emphasis">Time</em> and also appear in popular magazines such as <em class="emphasis">People</em> and <em class="emphasis">Vanity Fair</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p02">To survive, journals of political opinion usually depend on subsidies from wealthy individuals who support their views. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com"><em class="emphasis">Weekly Standard</em></a>, the voice of Republican neoconservatives and one of the most influential publications in Washington, with a circulation of approximately 75,000, loses around $5 million annually. It was initially owned and funded by media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which makes big profits elsewhere through its diverse holdings, such as Fox News and the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>. In 2009, it sold the <em class="emphasis">Weekly Standard</em> to the conservative Clarity Media Group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Television</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p01">People watch an average of thirty-four hours of television weekly. Over one thousand commercial, for-profit television stations in the United States broadcast over the airwaves; they also are carried, as required by federal law, by local cable providers. Most of them are affiliated with or, in fewer cases, owned by one of the networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), which provide the bulk of their programming. These networks produce news, public affairs, and sports programs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p02">They commission and finance from production companies, many of which they own, the bulk of the entertainment programming shown on their stations and affiliates. The most desired viewers are between eighteen and forty-nine because advertisements are directed at them. So the shows often follow standard formats with recurring characters: situation comedies, dramas about police officers and investigators, and doctors and lawyers, as well as romance, dance, singing, and other competitions. Sometimes they are spin-offs from programs that have done well in the audience ratings or copies of successful shows from the United Kingdom. “Reality” programming, heavily edited and sometimes scripted, of real people put into staged situations or caught unaware, has become common because it draws an audience and usually costs less to make than written shows. The highest-rated telecasts are usually football games, exceeded only by the Academy Awards.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p03">Unusual and risky programs are put on the air by networks and channels that may be doing poorly in the ratings and are willing to try something out of the ordinary to attract viewers. Executives at the relatively new Fox network commissioned <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thesimpsons.com"><em class="emphasis">The Simpsons</em></a>. Matt Groening, its creator, has identified the show’s political message this way: “Figures of authority might not always have your best interests at heart.…Entertain and subvert, that’s my motto.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_013">Quoted in Sanjiv Bhattacharya, “Homer’s Odyssey,” <em class="emphasis">Observer Magazine</em>, August 6, 2000, 19.</span> The show, satirizing American family life, government, politics, and the media, has become one of television’s longest running and most popular series worldwide.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p04">Cable is mainly a niche medium. Of the ninety or so ad-supported cable channels, ten (including USA, TNT, Fox News, A&amp;E, and ESPN) have almost a third of all the viewers. Other channels occasionally attract audiences through programs that are notable (<em class="emphasis">Mad Men</em> on American Movie Classics) or notorious (<em class="emphasis">Jersey Shore</em> on MTV). Cable channels thrive (or at least survive) financially because they receive subscriber fees from cable companies such as Comcast and Time-Warner.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p05">The networks still have the biggest audiences—the smallest of them (NBC) had more than twice as many viewers as the largest basic cable channel, USA. The networks’ evening news programs have an audience of 23 million per night compared with the 2.6 million of cable news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p06">Politics and government appear not only on television in news and public-affairs programs but also in courtroom dramas and cop shows. In the long-running and top-rated television show (with an audience of 21.93 million viewers on January 11, 2011), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis"><em class="emphasis">NCIS</em></a> (Naval Criminal Investigative Service), a team of attractive special agents conduct criminal investigations. The show features technology, sex, villains, and suspense. The investigators and their institutions are usually portrayed positively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Public Broadcasting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s04_p01">The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was created by the federal government in 1967 as a private, nonprofit corporation to oversee the development of public television and radio.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_014">William Hoynes, <em class="emphasis">Public Television for Sale</em> (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1994); and Marilyn Lashley, <em class="emphasis">Public Television</em> (New York: Greenwood, 1992).</span> CPB receives an annual allocation from Congress. Most of the funds are funneled to the more than three hundred public television stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and to over six hundred public radio stations, most affiliated with National Public Radio (NPR), to cover operating costs and the production and purchase of programs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s04_p02">CPB’s board members are appointed by the president, making public television and radio vulnerable or at least sensitive to the expectations of the incumbent administration. Congress sometimes charges the CPB to review programs for objectivity, balance, or fairness and to fund additional programs to correct alleged imbalances in views expressed.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_015">Twentieth-Century Fund Task Force on Public Television, <em class="emphasis">Quality Time</em> (New York: Twentieth-Century Fund Press, 1993), 36.</span> Conservatives charge public broadcasting with a liberal bias. In 2011 the Republican majority in the House of Representatives sought to withdraw its federal government funding.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s04_p03">About half of public broadcasting stations’ budgets come from viewers and listeners, usually responding to unremitting on-air appeals. Other funding comes from state and local governments, from state colleges and universities housing many of the stations, and from foundations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s04_p04">Corporations and local businesses underwrite programs in return for on-air acknowledgments akin to advertisements for their image and products. Their decisions on whether or not to underwrite a show tend to favor politically innocuous over provocative programs. Public television and radio thus face similar pressure from advertisers as their for-profit counterparts.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Commercial Radio</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s05_p01">Around ten thousand commercial FM and AM radio stations in the United States broadcast over the airwaves. During the 1990s, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) dropped many restrictions on ownership and essentially abandoned the requirement that stations must serve the “public interest.” This led to the demise of much public affairs programming and to a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions. Clear Channel Communications, then the nation’s largest owner, bought the second largest company, increasing its ownership to roughly 1,150 stations. The company was sold in 2008 to two private equity firms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s05_p02">Most radio programming is aimed at an audience based on musical preference, racial or ethnic background and language, and interests (e.g., sports). Much of the news programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary of media conglomerate Viacom. Even on all-news stations, the reports are usually limited to headlines and brief details. Talk radio, dominated by conservative hosts, reaches large audiences. We discuss it in more detail in <a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03#paletz_1.0-ch01_s03">Section 1.3 "Opinion and Commentary"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s06_p01">Four major companies produce, package, publicize, advertise, promote, and merchandise roughly 5,000 singles and 2,500 compact discs (CDs) each year. A key to success is getting a music video on MTV or similar stations. Around twelve million CDs used to be sold nationwide every week. This number has significantly decreased. The companies and performers now make music that is cheaply available online through services such as Apple’s iTunes store. Many people, especially students, download music from the Internet or burn CDs for themselves and others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s06_p02">Music often contains political content. Contrast Green Day’s scathing 2005 hit song “American Idiot” and its lyric “One nation controlled by the media” with Lee Greenwood’s patriotic “God Bless the USA.” Some rap lyrics celebrate capitalism and consumerism, promote violence against women, and endorse—or even advocate—attacks on the police and other authority figures.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s07_p01">The movie business is dominated by six major studios, which finance and distribute around 130 feature films each year. Mass-market logic usually pushes them to seek stories that “are sufficiently original that the audience will not feel it has already seen the movie, yet similar enough to past hits not to be too far out.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_016">Mark Litwak, <em class="emphasis">Reel Power</em> (New York: Morrow, 1986), 74.</span> Superheroes, science fiction and fantasy, sophomoric comedies, and animation dominate. Sequels are frequent. Special effects are common. In Robert Altman’s satire <em class="emphasis">The Player</em>, the protagonist says that the “certain elements” he needs to market a film successfully are violence, suspense, laughter, hope, heart, nudity, sex, and a happy ending.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s07_p02">It can cost well over $100 million to produce, advertise, and distribute a film to theaters. These costs are more or less recouped by US and overseas box office sales, DVD sales (declining) and rentals, revenue from selling broadcast rights to television, subscription cable, video on demand, and funds received from promoting products in the films (product placement). Increasingly important are Netflix and its competitors, which for a monthly charge make movies available by mail or streaming.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s07_p03">Many independent films are made, but few of them are distributed to theaters and even fewer seen by audiences. This situation is being changed by companies, such as Snag Films, that specialize in digital distribution and video on demand (including over the iPad).<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_017">Michael Cieply, “A Digital Niche for Indie Film,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 17, 2011, B5.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s07_p04">It is said in Hollywood that “politics is box office poison.” The financial failure of films concerned with US involvement in Iraq, such as <em class="emphasis">In the Valley of Elah</em>, appears to confirm this axiom. Nonetheless, the major studios and independents do sometimes make politically relevant movies. We refer to many of them in this book and provide a list at the end of each chapter. The five nominees for the 2005 Oscar for best picture all contained political content—<em class="emphasis">Brokeback Mountain</em> (homosexuality), <em class="emphasis">Capote</em> (a fiction writer’s complex relationship to two murderers he befriends and writes about), <em class="emphasis">Crash</em> (racial tension in Los Angeles), <em class="emphasis">Good Night and Good Luck</em> (CBS’s response to the Red Scare of the early 1950s), and <em class="emphasis">Munich</em> (Israeli–Palestinian relations).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Books</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s08_p01">Some 100,000 books are published annually. About “seventy percent of them will not earn back the money that their authors have been advanced.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_018">Ken Auletta, “Publish or Perish,” <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, April 26, 2010, 24–31, is the source for much of this discussion; the quotation is on p. 30.</span> There are literally hundreds of publishers, but six produce 60 percent of all books sold in the United States. Publishers’ income comes mainly from sales. A few famous authors command multimillion-dollar advances: President Bill Clinton received more than $10 million and President Bush around $7 million to write their memoirs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s08_p02">E-books are beginning to boom. The advantage for readers is obtaining the book cheaper and quicker than by mail or from a bookstore. For publishers, there are no more costs for printing, shipping, warehousing, and returns. But digital books could destroy bookstores if, for example, publishers sold them directly to the iPad. Indeed, publishers themselves could be eliminated if authors sold their rights to (say) Amazon.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s08_p03">Books featuring political revelations often receive widespread coverage in the rest of the media. They are excerpted in magazines and newspapers. Their authors appear on television and radio programs. An example is President George W. Bush’s former press secretary Scott McClellan, who, while praising the president in his memoir as authentic and sincere, also accused him of lacking in candor and competence.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_019">Scott McClellan, <em class="emphasis">What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington’s Culture of Deception</em> (New York: Public Affairs, 2008).</span></p>

Their contents relevant to politics and government are entertainment, news, and opinion. They are largely aimed at a vast, undifferentiated audience.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_p02">Information about or relevant to politics, government, and public policies commonly appears in the mass media in the form of news. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">News</a><span class="glossdef">Reports by journalists of selected events commonly involving violence, conflict, disasters, and scandals.</span></span> is a selective account of what happens in the world. Common subjects are violence (wars), crime (school shootings), natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes), and scandals (sexual, financial). The statements and actions of powerful or prominent people are news. So are human interest stories, such as the rescue of Private Jessica Lynch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_p03">News is timely, a breaking event, like an assassination attempt on a president. Or newly revealed information, such as a presidential candidate’s drunk-driving conviction, even if it happened years ago. Slow-moving processes that may be of vital importance (e.g., the spread of AIDS or global warming) take time to become news, often requiring a “peg”—the release of an alarmist study, a congressional hearing, or presidential speech—on which to hang the story.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Journalists</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">News is reported by journalists. They work under time pressure with tight deadlines to come up with stories around the clock. This job has become more difficult in recent years as budget cuts have led news organizations to demand more stories for more outlets from fewer reporters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">A majority of journalists are white, middle class, middle-aged, and male. Women now compose about one-third of the press corps and racial minorities around one-tenth. In a survey, 36 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 33 percent as Independents, and 18 percent as Republicans.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_020">For journalists’ backgrounds, see David H. Weaver, Randal A. Beam, Bonnie J. Brownlee, Paul S. Voakes, and G. Cleveland Wilhoit, <em class="emphasis">The American Journalist in the 21st Century</em> (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007), 20.</span> Reporters tend to be pro-choice, for gay rights, and in favor of protecting the environment. But they try to refrain from showing their preferences in their stories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">Any influence of reporters’ characteristics and opinions on their stories is limited by the norms of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">objectivity</a><span class="glossdef">In news reporting, impartiality and fairness, and the reporting of facts without opinion and including different sides of an issue.</span></span> they learn in journalism school or on the job. Specified in the profession’s code of ethics, these include reporting accurate information, not deliberately distorting or plagiarizing, and separating reporting from advocacy.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_021">Society of Professional Journalists, Code of Ethics, adopted September 1996.</span> Journalists are expected to report different sides of an issue, be impartial and fair, and exclude their personal opinions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_022">David T. Z. Mindich, <em class="emphasis">Just the Facts: How “Objectivity” Came to Define American Journalism</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1998).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p04">If they are found out, journalists who deliberately and blatantly violate the profession’s ethics are punished. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reporter Jayson Blair was dismissed after it was discovered that he had fabricated or plagiarized around forty of the six hundred articles he had written for the paper; editors resigned in the wake of the discoveries. Jack Kelly was the star foreign correspondent for <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> and had worked for the paper for over twenty years when he resigned in January 2004, accused of plagiarism and of inventing parts or all of some of his stories.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Comparing Content</h3>
            <p class="simpara">Depictions of Journalists</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p05">Many of our impressions of journalists, their behavior, importance, and trustworthiness come from the media.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_023">For a study of movie depictions of American journalism, see Matthew C. Ehrlich, <em class="emphasis">Journalism in the Movies</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2004).</span> Media depictions repeat two types best captured in the classic film <em class="emphasis">His Girl Friday</em>: reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) and her editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant).</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p06">The first type exemplified by Hildy is the journalist as intrepid seeker after truth and crusader for justice. The most famous real-life equivalents are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reporters who helped uncover the Watergate scandal and wrote a book about it, <em class="emphasis">All the President’s Men</em>, which was turned into a popular Hollywood movie. Even some caustic satires of the news business contain versions of the journalist as noble loner. In <em class="emphasis">Network</em>, Peter Finch plays a television news anchor who begins to go insane on camera, shouting “I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore.” In the movie, his pain and anguish are exploited by amoral network executives. In real life, his battle cry became the theme of citizens’ tax revolts in the late seventies and could be heard at Tea Party rallies thirty years later.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p07">The second type of journalist, characterized by Walter Burns, is more common in the entertainment media. At their worst, as in Billy Wilder’s classic <em class="emphasis">Ace in the Hole</em>, such reporters cynically and callously exploit the disasters of the human condition. But even less bitter films show reporters as inevitably led astray from their devotion to the truth to the point that they destroy lives and reputations in their reckless search for an exclusive story ahead of other reporters (a <strong class="emphasis bold">scoop</strong>) that is dramatic and shocking. In <em class="emphasis">Absence of Malice</em>, Sally Field plays a reporter who ends up besmirching a good man’s (Paul Newman) reputation. In <em class="emphasis">Broadcast News</em>, William Hurt and Albert Brooks compete to become a news anchor. Hurt—good-looking, smooth, unscrupulous, and none too bright—wins out over the dumpier, knowledgeable, and dedicated Brooks.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p08">A contemporary example of the second type is Rita Skeeter. Introduced by J. K. Rowling in her vastly popular Harry Potter series, Skeeter writes for the <em class="emphasis">Daily Prophet</em>, <em class="emphasis">Witch Weekly</em>, and other publications. She is untrustworthy, unscrupulous, vindictive, and vile. She justifies her behavior with the motto “Our readers have a right to the truth.” But her news stories are error-strewn and full of lies. They destroy friendships, inflict pain and suffering, and deprive decent people of their jobs. Rita Skeeter gets scoops by turning herself into a bug. The moral is that such journalists are nasty bugs.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_024">J. K. Rowling, <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> (New York: Scholastic Press, 2000), especially 433–53, 511–15, 611–15, and 726–28; the quotation is on p. 450.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">Journalists follow standard procedures to obtain the news. They go to the scene, especially of wars and disasters. They talk to people who have participated in, witnessed, or claim to know what happened. They dig into records. Easing their job, many events, such as press conferences, trials, and elections, are scheduled ahead of time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p01">News organizations guarantee stories by assigning reporters to cover distinct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beats</a><span class="glossdef">Institutions, organizations, and subjects that a reporter is assigned to cover regularly.</span></span> such as the White House or specific subjects such as environmental policy. Institutions and subjects not on reporters’ beats (off the beaten track, so to speak) generate few stories unless they do something to become newsworthy. Sometimes events thrust them into prominence, as when the banking crisis of 2008 raised questions about the regulatory effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p01">Journalists interact with and rely extensively on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sources</a><span class="glossdef">People, often in government, who, for one reason or another, provide reporters with information.</span></span>—generally people in government and politics, especially those in high positions of authority—to provide them with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scoops</a><span class="glossdef">News obtained ahead of other reporters.</span></span> and quotations. Other sources are whistle-blowers, who reveal information they have about dubious activities, outrages, or scandals. Depending on their motives, sources either provide information openly and unreservedly or leak it subject to various conditions such as anonymity.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_025">Stephen Hess, <em class="emphasis">The Government/Press Connection: Press Officers and Their Offices</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 1984), chap. 7.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p02">Often the reporter-source relationship is symbiotic: they need each other. Reporters need sources for news. Sources need reporters to get their views and information into the news, to obtain favorable coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p03">Sometimes the relationship is adversarial, with reporters pressing a reluctant source for information. Sources must often respond to reporters’ ideas of what is news. Information from one beat may inspire a news story that another beat wants to keep quiet. Refusal to reveal information may result in negative coverage and in sources becoming targets in reporters’ and columnists’ stories.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s05_p02">Video feeds supplied by the AP and Reuters are the source of much of the televised international news. Subscribers are sent video accompanied by natural sound without narration and brief printed informational scripts. Four of CBS’s eight foreign correspondents are based in London doing voice-overs for these feeds for broadcast on the network’s news programs.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Prominence and Presentation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p01">As a result of widely agreed-upon criteria of newsworthiness, the process of gathering the news, and the use of news services, the news media often report many of the same stories. Only a few stories are featured prominently due to limitations in broadcast prime time and front-page print space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Nonetheless, there are some differences among the media in the range and type of news on which they focus. For example, the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, with its stable of reporters in Washington, DC, and foreign correspondents, emphasizes government and politics in the United States and abroad. Cable news channels focus more on crimes and celebrities. Aside from a few stories, such as the war in Iraq and natural disasters, they give short shrift to foreign stories. In fact, the Fox News Channel has a segment titled “Around the World in 80 Seconds.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p03">The media also differ stylistically in how they present the news. The <em class="emphasis">Times</em> does it with relative sobriety. Cable channels dramatize their reports by announcing “breaking news,” using graphic captions, accompanying stories with pulsating music, engaging in fast-paced editing, and repeatedly admonishing viewers to “stay with us.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p04">Television news is picture driven: stories with appealing, dramatic, or even available camera footage are more likely to be played prominently than those without. Viewers are unaware of what is not shown, what happened before or after the picture was taken, and whether or not the shot was staged. Camera angles, distance from the subject, especially close-ups, length of shot, camera movement, and editing all influence viewers’ impressions. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but it can also mislead, as <a class="xref" href="#paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_n01">Note 1.17 "Enduring Image"</a> reveals.</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Enduring Image</h3>
            <p class="simpara">The Overthrow of Saddam Hussein</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p05">The toppling of a dictator’s statue is an enduring image, symbolizing the literal collapse of a regime’s authority and the massive uprising and joy of a population freed at last from tyranny. On April 9, 2003, a US mechanized vehicle using a cable pulled down Saddam Hussein’s mammoth statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square. The square was sealed off by US marines. The few people in it were US soldiers, Iraqis from the United States, promoted “Free Iraqi Forces Militia” (comprising exiles who had recently been returned to the country by the Pentagon), and journalists.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p06">On television the statue falls, the crowd cheers. On the front pages of newspapers in the United States and around the world, the Reuters news-agency photograph shows the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue under the watchful eye of an American soldier. The images symbolize the US defeat of the dictator and his regime and the Iraqi people celebrating their newfound freedom. Wider shots of the square, revealing that only a handful of people were in the plaza, were far less common.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_028">The differences between the photographs was brought to our attention in the May/June 2003 issue of <em class="emphasis">Extra!</em>, p. 8.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p07">The first photograph of the statue being pulled down reflects news values of vividness, drama, and conflict. It spectacularly hearkens back to the removal of statues of Lenin and Stalin after the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. The alternative photos, showing much more of the relatively empty square, lacked dramatic news values and thus their symbolic effects.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p08">Because the news media found the dramatic image to be irresistible, they reinforced a frame, pushed by the Bush administration, of a jubilant Iraqi population welcoming its liberators. But the meaning of an image can change. Now, for many people, the falling statue represents the illusion of a US military success that turned into a quagmire of frustration.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p01">As we document throughout our book, people involved in public life understand that their election and reelection, their effectiveness in elected and appointed office, and their ability to achieve their policies often depend on how they and their deliberations and debates, disagreements and conflicts, cooperation and consensus, actions and inactions, and struggles for power, are portrayed by the media. They know that media depictions can influence people’s opinions, understandings of policy problems and notions of solutions, and can encourage or discourage participation in politics.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p04">Despite these attempts at manipulation, the news media’s coverage of people in public life is not necessarily favorable. Three common types of coverage are lap-dog, watch-dog, and attack-dog journalism.</p>

Lance Bennett, “An Introduction to Journalism Norms and Representations of Politics,” <em class="emphasis">Political Communication</em> 13, no. 4 (October–December 1996): 373–84.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_s01_p02">A notable example of the news media as lap dogs was their coverage of the Bush administration’s claims in 2002–2003 that Iraq must be attacked because it possessed weapons of mass destruction. Leaders of the Democratic Party did not forcefully challenge the White House’s official story, plans, and rationale. Most of the news media then transmitted the administration’s arguments without subjecting them to sustained analysis and criticism.</p>

This type of coverage can be provoked by dramatic events, such as Hurricane Katrina, to which the Bush administration responded unconvincingly.

Outraged reporters asked so many impassioned questions of administration officials about their inadequate response to Katrina that the Salon website compiled a “Reporters Gone Wild” video clip.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_032">See W.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_p02">The media do far more than report the news. They are full of pundits, talking heads, and partisans who are busy expressing opinions and commenting on the news. These reactions and responses can contribute to a marketplace of ideas, informed public discussion, and greater understanding of politics, government, and public policies. Often, however, they result in conflict and cacophony: topics are broached too briefly in too little time, assertions dominate analysis, and shouting and squabbling drown out thought.</p>

Some newspapers carry a range of opinions, others are ideologically monolithic. Cartoons, when the newspaper features them, often comment critically on public officials, policies, and current events.

These channels plus C-SPAN3 also air an array of political events, including election debates, political advertisements, press conferences, discussion forums, and interviews with news makers, journalists, and authors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">The television networks’ Sunday morning interview programs usually feature prominent policymakers, including government officials and well-known politicians.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">Comedy can venture where other entertainment forms fear to tread. Comedy has a point of view, presents an argument, and often lacerates, usually from a liberal perspective (as, for example, <em class="emphasis">Saturday Night Live</em>’s fake news segment).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p02">Comedy Central’s <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailyshow.com"><em class="emphasis">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em></a> satirizes the news media and the politics and government they depict, especially the president. Jon Stewart, the acerbic yet charming host, confronts and analyzes the dissembling pronouncements of people in government. The show’s fake correspondents parody the behavior of real reporters to reveal the limitations of news formats and of objectivity. The show’s effects are achieved through Stewart’s comments and interjections, the incisive writing, and the clever editing of videos.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_040">For a thoughtful analysis, see Geoffrey Baym, “The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism,” <em class="emphasis">Political Communication</em> 22, no. 3 (July–September 2005): 259–76; and Jeffrey P.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p03">On rare occasions, Stewart has tried to influence public policy. In December 2010, he effectively pushed (embarrassed, shamed) congressional Republicans to pass a bill they had been blocking that would approve funding for medical benefits to firefighters, police officers, and health workers who had become sick from working at Ground Zero on and after 9/11. In one program he interviewed four of the first responders who had become ill.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Agenda Setting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p01">A series of experiments has demonstrated that when television news places more attention and emphasis on certain issues, such as crime, the public tends to see those issues as more important problems requiring government action. The public then judges politicians according to how well they respond to the issues.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_042">Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder, <em class="emphasis">News That Matters: Television and American Opinion</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p02">Consider the television show <em class="emphasis">24</em>. It told its viewers that terrorists were a constant threat to the United States and likely to strike with horrible destructiveness anywhere at any time. At its peak, the show had a weekly audience of approximately fifteen million viewers and reached millions more through DVD sales.</p>

The flip side of agenda setting is that when the media ignore issues or policy areas, so too does the public.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p01">The media are not simply important in getting people to think about an issue; they influence <em class="emphasis">how</em> people think about it. Scholars refer to this media power as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">framing</a><span class="glossdef">The central idea or theme with which media personnel organize a story and thus give it a point of view.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_043">Brian F. Schaffner and Patrick J. Sellers, <em class="emphasis">Winning with Words: The Origins and Impact of Political Framing</em> (New York: Routledge, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p02">Journalists bring a perspective to bear on events, highlight certain aspects at the expense of others, to create a coherent narrative.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_044">Stephen D. Reese, Oscar H. Gandy Jr., and August E. Grant, eds., <em class="emphasis">Framing Public Life: Perspectives on Media and Our Understanding of the Social World</em> (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2001).</span> Such a narrative names protagonists and antagonists, identifies some of the causes of the event described, outlines moral judgments, and may suggest solutions. Framing is inherent in the process of selecting, editing, organizing, and presenting stories. It is often expressed in the television anchorperson’s introduction and in newspaper headlines and opening paragraphs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p03">The meaning of an event can change dramatically based on how it is framed by and in the media. For example, the public understands a demonstration quite differently depending on whether the news frames it as an exercise of freedom of speech or as a threat to law and order.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p04">Of course, some frames are more convincing than others. A frame’s impact may depend on who is promoting it, what other frames it is competing against, and how frequently it is repeated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p05">Often, though, news frames are predictable.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_045">Daniel C. Hallin, <em class="emphasis">The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), 116–17.</span> They express widely shared assumptions and values. The news media framed the events of 9/11 as terrorist attacks on the United States with a response from Americans of national heroism, horror, and mourning.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p06">Out of habit and to simplify complex subjects, journalists tend to cover government and politics with a relatively small repertoire of familiar frames. Relations within and between the branches of government are typically framed as conflicts. Stories often frame politicians as motivated by partisanship and the desire for reelection. Stories about government agencies are frequently framed around bureaucratic incompetence, waste, and corruption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p07">Framing influences politics by reinforcing or changing what people think of an issue. Different frames call for different policy solutions. Thus <em class="emphasis">24</em> told its viewers that in the grim choice between security and liberty, coercion must prevail, that torture is essential to extract information from terrorists to forestall (usually just in time) their lethal schemes. According to Human Rights First, the number of acts of torture on prime-time television increased from fewer than four before 9/11 to more than a hundred. It used to be the villains who tortured, now it is the heroes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_046">See Jane Mayer, “Whatever It Takes,” <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, February 19 &amp; 26, 2007, 66–82, esp. 66 and 68.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Priming</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p01">Media frames can provide criteria that audience members use to make judgments about government institutions, public officials, and issues. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">When media (news stories) ascribe responsibility for a problem to a person or institution.</span></span>. It can occur when news stories identify the person or institution to blame for an event, such as the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. The president is often held responsible for the nation’s problems. Priming effects are strongest “when the news frames a problem as if it were the president’s business, when viewers are prepared to regard the problem as important, and when they see the problem as entangled in the duties and obligation of the presidency.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_047">Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder, <em class="emphasis">News That Matters: Television and American Opinion</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 97 and 110.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p02">Because of its intrinsic importance, reemphasized by the news and entertainment media, fighting terrorism continues as a prominent issue. The president is seen as primarily responsible. Presidential candidates’ competence to combat terrorism thus becomes an important criterion by which the electorate judges them. Note, in this respect, that some of <em class="emphasis">24</em>’s presidents could not be trusted to execute that duty and obligation effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Mobilizing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p01">The media affect what people think about in politics and how they think about it. They also influence what, if anything, people do about politics, problems, and policies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p02">Media contents can <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mobilize</a><span class="glossdef">To encourage, even inspire, individuals to engage in political behavior and action.</span></span> individuals to engage in political behavior, from contacting public officials, to voting, to protesting, to committing violence. In the 1960s, television coverage increased participation in the nonviolent protests of the civil rights movement against segregation in the South.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_048">Taeku Lee, <em class="emphasis">Mobilizing Public Opinion: Black Insurgency and Racial Attitudes in the Civil Rights Era</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002).</span> Continuous coverage of the 2009 health care legislation contributed to generating a wide range of participation by the public. Partisan media particularly foster citizen engagement in politics, as Fox News did for the Tea Party.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p03">The media can influence people in politics without the public being involved at all. Politicians are far more voracious consumers of the news than is the average American. When issues are heavily covered in the media, officials take such prominence as a sign that they may well be called to account for their actions, even if the public has not yet spoken out. And they speak and behave differently than they did when the issues were obscure. Media attention tends to encourage action and speed up the policy process, if only for politicians to get the issue off the table.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p01">Julian Paul Assange founded <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">WikiLeaks.org</a><span class="glossdef">An organization that exposes the secrets of governments, corporations, and other institutions.</span></span> in 2007 to expose the secrets of governments, corporations, and other institutions.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p02">Assange followed up in November 2010 with a dump of classified cables sent by US diplomats from their embassies during the last three years. The cables detailed the diplomats’ dealings with and honest assessments of both the foreign countries where they were stationed and their leaders, revealing the reality beneath the rhetoric: that Saudi Arabia has urged that Iran be bombed, that Shell dominates the government of Nigeria, that China launched a cyber attack on Google, and that the US State Department urged its employees to collect biometrical information on foreign diplomats serving at the United Nations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p03"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info">WikiLeaks</a> released the material to selected leading newspapers in the United States (<em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>), the United Kingdom (<em class="emphasis">Guardian</em>), and elsewhere, deferring to the journalists to decide which ones were news, which could be made public, and whether to redact names from them. Nonetheless, their release could damage the careers of some US diplomats and discloses the names of informants, thereby endangering them. The cables could be subject to foreign governments’ and private companies’ data-mining and pattern-analysis programs. Consequently, the US Justice and Defense Departments and other organizations tried to stop Assange, to avoid further leaks, and to punish the leakers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p04">News organizations, with their legitimacy and experienced journalists, have gone online. They often add details and links missing from their broadcast or published versions of their stories. Their sophisticated technology keeps their sites fresh with the latest news, photos, and real-time audio and video. In February 2011, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation announced the arrival of <em class="emphasis">The Daily</em>, a general-interest publication for tablet computers.

The ideologically conservative <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> came to fame when Matt Drudge used his web portal to spread the latest news and rumors about the relationship between President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p09">Breithbart made a splash with videos posted on Big Government in September 2009 regarding ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). Since 2006, conservatives had attacked ACORN, accusing it of voter fraud. This became the dominant frame and set the agenda for media coverage of the organization. Now the hidden-camera, heavily edited footage (the complete original video footage has never been fully disclosed) showed ACORN employees offering advice to a man and woman, who were posing as a pimp and a prostitute, proposing to bring underage Salvadoran girls into the United States to be sexually enslaved. The footage became a top story on the <em class="emphasis">Glenn Beck Show</em>, the rest of Fox News, and conservative talk radio. In December 2009, the Congressional Research Service issued a report exonerating ACORN of any wrongdoing. A few months later, ACORN went out of business.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_051">Peter Dreier and Christopher R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p01">The new media can aim at more discrete, specialized audiences, narrowcasting rather than broadcasting. Often controlled by individual communicators, their content is usually aimed at smaller and more socially, economically, and perhaps politically distinct audiences than the mass media. This fragmentation of the mass audience means that the old mass-media pursuit of lowest-common-denominator content may no longer be financially necessary or viable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p02">There are cable channels devoted to women, African Americans, and Hispanics, as well as for buffs of news, weather, history, and sports. DVDs and CDs enable the cheap reproduction of a wide range of films and recordings that no longer have to find a mass market to break even. Although the recording industry is selling fewer and fewer CDs and is phasing out music formats with small audiences (e.g., classical, jazz), artists can produce their own CDs and find a far-flung audience, particularly through web-based commerce such as Amazon.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p03">Satellite radio is the fastest growing radio market. It uses technology that broadcasts a clear signal from space to receivers anywhere in the world. Providers XM and Sirius offer uninterrupted programming for a subscription fee. Listeners have hundreds of program options. Broadcast radio stations are no longer limited by the range of a signal across terrain but through the web can reach listeners who make up an audience that is less bounded by geography than by shared cultural, social, and political interests.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p04">For people interested in government, politics, and public affairs, there are web magazines such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com"><em class="emphasis">Slate</em></a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com"><em class="emphasis">Salon</em></a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com"><em class="emphasis">Politico</em></a> with its staff of established political reporters.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Content</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p01">As major news organizations have gone online, they have hired technologically skilled young people. At first, these people would primarily reprocess content. Now they create it, as they know how to take advantage of the technology. Thanks to cell-phone cameras, webcams, and social networks, ordinary people can create, store, sort, share, and show digital videos. YouTube is the go-to website for finding obscure and topical streaming video clips. Home videos, remixes, and television excerpts are posted by users (also by the television networks). YouTube has millions of videos and daily viewers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p02">People can use video clips to hold politicians accountable by revealing their gaffes, showing the contradictions in their statements and behavior, and thereby exposing their dissembling, their exaggerations, and even their falsehoods. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had to say that she had misremembered when her claim that she had been under sniper fire at the airport during her 1996 visit to Bosnia as First Lady was refuted by videos shown on YouTube that attained millions of views.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p03">People can become citizen journalists and create contents by reporting on subjects usually ignored by the news media. Examples include <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://tv.oneworld.net">OneWorldTV</a>’s human rights and development site and short videos on subjects such as land expropriation in Kenya, gang reform in Ecuador, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveleak.com">LiveLeak</a>’s coverage of executions in Saudi Arabia.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p04">People can become citizen journalists as eyewitnesses to events. Examples of their reporting include the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011, Hurricane Katrina that hit the US Gulf Coast in 2005, and the massacre of students at Virginia Tech University in 2006. They showed some of what happened and documented the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the authorities’ responses. Mainstream media have incorporated citizen journalism into their news products. CNN’s <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ireport.cnn.com">“iReport,”</a> in which “you take control of the news,” encourages average people to submit stories with accompanying images. Reports span numerous topics, including candidates on the campaign and pet stories.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p05">The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.freepress.net">Free Press</a> now has a site called MediaFail where people can post egregious examples of media derelictions and failures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Blogging</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Blogs</a><span class="glossdef">Online diaries whose authors post information, including ideas and opinions.</span></span> are online diaries whose authors post information, including ideas and opinions. Blogs may permit feedback from readers and provide hyperlinks to other online contents that may enrich the discussion. Many people blog; the most popular political blog sites, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://wwwinstapundit.com">Instapundit</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://dailykos.com">DailyKos</a>, claim over 75,000 visitors per day, but few are widely read. Nonetheless, there are thousands of political blogs on the web: the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a>, a news aggregator with some original material, claims more than eighteen hundred bloggers—none of them paid.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p02">Blogging can be seen as a new form of journalism without deadlines or broadcast schedules. But it does not replace reporting. Most bloggers rely on material issued elsewhere for their information: domestic and foreign newspapers, government documents, academic papers, and other media.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p03">Nonetheless, the “blogosphere” can hold public officials accountable by amplifying and spreading information, especially when many bloggers cover the same subject, a phenomenon known as “blogswarm.” For example, Mississippi Republican senator Trent Lott, at a reception honoring his South Carolina colleague Strom Thurmond’s hundredth birthday, spoke approvingly of the latter’s prosegregationist 1948 presidential campaign: “When Strom Thurmond ran for president we voted for him. We’re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead we wouldn’t have had all these problems over all of these years either.” The journalists in attendance little noted his comment. Bloggers saw the quote in a story on ABC News’s daily online comment “The Note.” They highlighted and linked it to previous statements on racial issues by Thurmond and Lott. The bloggers’ comments were picked up by the news media. As a result, Lott subsequently resigned as Senate Majority Leader.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p04">Bloggers can hold the news media accountable. One important way is by challenging the media’s framing of a story. For example, conservative bloggers criticize reporters for framing stories about abortion, gay rights, and religion from a liberal perspective.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p05">Bloggers also challenge the media’s stories themselves. On the <em class="emphasis">60 Minutes Wednesday</em> segment of September 8, 2005, anchor Dan Rather presented documents purportedly showing that President George W. Bush had received preferential treatment in joining the Texas Air National Guard in the early 1970s and thus avoided military service in Vietnam. The report was a scoop that had been rushed onto the air. Conservative Internet forums and bloggers immediately pointed out that, because of their format and typography, the documents were forged. The accusation quickly gained national attention by the news media and was soon corroborated. Rather’s long career at CBS was ended sooner than he and the network had planned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p01">The ability of new media to realize their potential and promise for improving citizen education and enhancing public life is limited in five ways.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p02">First, political websites and bloggers generally lack the resources of the news media and the knowledge and expertise of journalists to cover and investigate government, politics, and public policies in depth. They react to rather than originate the news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p03">Second, the new media encourage people to expose themselves to contents (people and perspectives) they already agree with. The audience for Fox News is overwhelmingly Republican, while Democrats gravitate to MSNBC and Comedy Central. Liberals find stories that support their views on the Huffington Post, conservatives on the National Review Online. Liberal blogs link to other liberal blogs, conservative blogs to other conservative blogs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p04">Third, the new media are rife with muddle and nonsense, distortion and error. When the journalist Hunter S. Thompson died, an Internet site reported President Nixon’s opinion that Thompson “represented the dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character.” In fact, Thompson said that about Nixon.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p05">Worse, the new media are a fount of rumor, innuendo, invective, and lies. The Indian wire service Press Trust quoted an anonymous Indian provincial official stating that President Obama’s official state visit to India would cost $2 billion ($200 million a day). The story was picked up by the Drudge Report, other online sites, and conservative talk-radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage. Glenn Beck presented the trip as a vacation accompanied by thirty-four warships and three thousand people. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-MN) repeated the claim to Anderson Cooper on his CNN program. This inspired him to track it down, reveal its falsity, and show how it had been perpetuated.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_052">Reported by Thomas L. Friedman in “Too Good to Check,” his column in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 17, 2010, A27.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p06">Even worse, the new media can promote and express anger, hatred, rage, and fanaticism. When American journalist Daniel Pearl was beheaded by his Al Qaeda captors in Pakistan in May 2002, the action was videotaped and distributed over the Internet on a grainy video titled “The Slaughter of the Spy-Journalist, the Jew Daniel Pearl.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_053">Mariane Pearl’s memoir of her husband, <em class="emphasis">A Mighty Heart</em> (New York: Scribner, 2004), was made into a film released in 2007.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p07">Fourth is the possibility of the new media falling increasingly under the control of media conglomerates and giant corporations. Google has purchased YouTube. This could eventually subject them to the same demands placed on the mass media: how to finance the production of content and make a profit. Indeed, advertising has become far more prevalent in and on the new media. Of course acquisitions don’t always succeed: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation bought and then sold MySpace after failing to make it a financial or social networking success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p08">Fifth, the new media are a threat to privacy. Google logs all the searches made on it and stores the information indefinitely. Relatedly, the new media tend to defer to government. AOL, Microsoft, and Yahoo, but not Google, have complied with requests from the US Justice Department for website addresses and search terms. Google in China omits links to sites that the Chinese government does not want its citizens to see.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s05_p09">In the United States there are <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> and its network, including the gossip sites Jezebel and Deadspin. They have no compunctions about breaching people’s privacy—even if it means violating journalistic norms by paying for information, as they did in the case of the sex diary written in the form of a thesis of a recent Duke University graduate and also a story concerning quarterback Brett Favre’s sexual behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Political Potential</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p01">Relatively few Internet users attend to politics or government or public policies.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_054">For a critical view of the political effectiveness of the Internet, see Matthew Hindman, <em class="emphasis">The Myth of Digital Democracy</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008).</span> Nonetheless, the new media are rife with political potential. They can convey a wide range of information and views. There are sites for people of every political persuasion interested in any policy issue (e.g., drugs, education, health, environment, immigration). These sites can encourage discussion and debate, stimulate political participation, raise funds, mobilize voters, and inspire civic engagement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p02">The new media allow politicians, political parties, interest and advocacy groups, as well as individuals to bypass the traditional media and reach the public. They can try to control their image by deciding what information to release and selecting congenial media through which to communicate it—to their benefit but not necessarily our enlightenment. Sarah Palin, for example, uses Twitter, Facebook, appearances on Fox News (the network paid for a television studio in her home), a reality television show, newspaper columns, and two best-selling books to communicate her message. She usually avoids appearing on shows whose hosts may be hostile to or even critical of her. (The belief that public figures, including Palin, personally write everything issued in their names is questionable; President Obama has admitted that he doesn’t write his Twitter feeds).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p03">The new media offer people the potential opportunity to transcend the mass media. As newspaper columnist Thomas L. Friedman wrote rather hyperbolically, “When everyone has a blog, a MySpace page or Facebook entry, everyone is a publisher. When everyone has a cell phone with a camera in it, everyone is a paparazzo. When everyone can upload video on YouTube, everyone is a filmmaker. When everyone is a publisher, paparazzo or filmmaker, everyone else is a public figure.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_055">Thomas L. Friedman, “The World Is Watching,” <em class="emphasis">International Herald Tribune</em>, June 28, 2007, 6.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p04">In this section we have seen how the new media are changing the relationship between communication on the one hand and government and politics on the other. They make more information than ever before accessible and available. They facilitate narrowcasting, the creation of content, and blogging. Despite limitations on their ability to improve citizen education and enhance public life, the new media are rife with political potential, particularly for civic education.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_056">On the importance of civic education for young people, see Peter Levine, <em class="emphasis">The Future of Democracy: Developing the Next Generation of American Citizens</em> (Medford, MA: Tufts University Press, 2007).</span></p>

                <p class="simpara">You Can Be a Journalist</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p05">The emerging communications system in the United States, with its heady mix of traditional mass media and new media, offers a startling array of opportunities for citizens to intervene and get something done in politics and government. The opportunities are especially rich for young people who are well versed in new technologies, and they are charting new paths in political discourse.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p06">Scoop08.com, the “first-ever daily national student newspaper,” was launched on November 4, 2007—a year before the presidential election. The goal of the paper was to bring a youthful focus to campaign news and political issues, as well as to cover topics and political personalities that escaped mainstream media attention. There were almost fifty beats covering aspects of the 2008 election including major and minor political parties, gender and sexuality, the environment, technology, and even sports.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p07">Reporters and editors came from over four hundred high schools and colleges nationwide. Their backgrounds were ethnically and socially diverse. All volunteers, students who wanted to become involved responded to an open invitation on the website’s homepage: “This is your newsroom—Get involved.” Scoop08’s web-based platform allowed its young reporters to file conventional stories as well as to post videos, blog entries, cartoons, and instant polls.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p08">The online newspaper was founded by coeditors Alexander Heffner, seventeen, a senior at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and Andrew Mangino, twenty, a junior at Yale University. The two met when they were interns on Senator Hillary Clinton’s Senate reelection campaign. With people aged eighteen to twenty-nine making up 25 percent of the 2008 electorate, Heffner and Magino wanted to provide a mechanism for generating student interest and activity during the election. “We noticed there was a void when it came to national, grassroots, student journalism that really could have an impact on issues of importance. This is an increasingly politically engaged generation that is able to network online and to work professionally, academically, and socially in this venue,” stated Heffner.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_057">Laura Smith-Spark, “Young US Voters May Get Scoop in 2008,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, November 4, 2007.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_s06_p09">Contributors to Scoop08 found the experience fulfilling. Hadley Nagel, a correspondent from Nightengale-Bamford School, stated, “If our generation is the future, we who write for Scoop08 will be shaping history.” A comment by Zoe Baker from Kennebunk High School reflected the ideals expressed by many of the young reporters: “Scoop08 has the opportunity to reassert journalistic integrity.”</p>
