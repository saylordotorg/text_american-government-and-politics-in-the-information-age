        <h2 class="title editable block">The Right to Keep and Bear Arms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">The Second Amendment reads, “A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Is this a right of self-defense that is akin to the protection of one’s dwelling guaranteed by other amendments?<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_026">Joyce Lee Malcolm, <em class="emphasis">To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994).</span> Or is it simply a basis for states to build militias, balancing off the standing army of the national government—in which case the gradual replacement of volunteer state militias by the National Guard rendered the Second Amendment obsolete?<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_027">H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel, <em class="emphasis">The Militia and the Right to Arms, Or, How the Second Amendment Fell Silent</em> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Most crime rates in the United States are similar to those of countries such as Canada or Australia. But the United States has a far higher rate of violent crime, in part because of the greater availability of firearms. A large majority of the public supports restrictions on the sale of firearms, but few policies have been enacted to do so. Although opponents of gun control are outnumbered, they are more likely than supporters to vote on this issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Policy debate on gun control usually occurs only after a dramatic, heavily covered news event like an assassination or a massacre at a school. One political scientist described the result as “furious politics, marginal policy.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_028">Robert J. Spitzer, <em class="emphasis">The Politics of Gun Control</em> (Chatham, NJ: Chatham House, 1995), 168.</span> For example, after the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in 1968, Congress debated President Lyndon Johnson’s proposal for a federal system of firearm registration and licensing of gun owners but passed only limited, ineffective legislation. In 1994, dramatic fights over banning assault weapons and mandating a waiting period for gun purchases produced a law with huge loopholes when it failed to cover gun shows.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p04">The “right to keep and bear arms” has been debated by the public and politicians more than by courts. But in June 2008, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5–4, ruled that individuals have the right to bear arms. This decision, an interpretation of the Second Amendment, struck down the District of Columbia’s thirty-two-year-old law banning the possession of handguns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_029"><em class="emphasis">District of Columbia v. Heller</em>, 554 US 570 (2008).</span> In June 2010, the Court, again by a vote of 5–4, applied the ruling to cities and states by overturning Chicago’s ban on handguns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_030"><em class="emphasis">McDonald v. Chicago</em>, 561 US ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (2010).</span> The Court has not prohibited all legislation and limitation of guns, but such governmental actions would likely conflict with the Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Searches and Seizures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">The Fourth Amendment prevents the government from conducting “unreasonable searches and seizures.” A reasonable search is conducted with a warrant issued by a judge and based on probable cause. What is “unreasonable” varies with how much privacy people can expect when they are being searched. Cars are less private than houses, so rules for searches of cars are less stringent. And government agencies can state reasons to compel persons not suspected of a crime to submit to searches and seizures. The goal of preventing airplanes from being hijacked authorizes mandatory searches of persons and their property before boarding aircraft and allows the confiscation of objects deemed dangerous.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Electronic Searches</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p01">New technologies complicate searches and seizures. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment did not simply restrict physical entry: it “protects people, not places.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_031"><em class="emphasis">Olmstead v. United States</em>, 277 US 438 (1928) and <em class="emphasis">Katz v. United States</em>, 389 US 347 (1967).</span> The pivotal test is whether a person has “a legitimate expectation of privacy” regardless of the technological means used to search. Thus the Court has held that the use of heat-sensing devices able to find intensive marijuana farms inside closets requires a search warrant as much as would a physical entry to one’s house.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_032"><em class="emphasis">Kyllo v. US</em>, 533 US 27 (2001).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p02">New technologies can also intrude into formerly private domains hitherto free from the potentially prying eye of government. For example, e-mail passes through many portals en route to delivery, each of which may be available for search without the sender’s or receiver’s knowledge. E-mail and web searches are still available in shadowy form even after the hard drive has seemingly been erased, and they can be searched for key words or other patterns efficiently. Police and prosecutors now have new weapons at their disposal in tracking down possible criminal activity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p03">The massive computerization of information tempts the government even more. In May 2004, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on data mining. It documented 52 federal agencies conducting 122 projects to collect, analyze, and use identifiable information on US persons for national security and law enforcement purposes. These numbers, which omit classified projects, are probably low-ball estimates.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Electronic Eavesdropping</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s02_p01">In 2006, newspapers leaked word of a secret executive order signed by President George W. Bush authorizing electronic eavesdropping on computerized and cell phone conversation without a warrant.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_033">For revelations and details, see Eric Lichtblau, <em class="emphasis">Bush’s Law: The Remaking of American Justice</em> (New York: Pantheon, 2008).</span> Bush claimed that the inherent powers of the president and Congress’s authorization of force to respond to the 9/11 attacks allowed him to initiate this policy. Members of Congress, unhappy that the program had been put into place without their knowledge, supported legislation obliging the president to seek warrants from a secret court.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Exclusionary Rule</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s03_p01">The Fourth Amendment’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exclusionary rule</a><span class="glossdef">Judicial rule applied to federal and state courts that prohibits the use of evidence in trial when it is not legally obtained.</span></span> prevents evidence from an illegal search or seizure being introduced against a defendant in court. The Supreme Court adopted this rule for federal cases in 1914 and extended it to states in 1961.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s03_p02">Law enforcement officers have long bridled at the exclusionary rule and claim that “technicalities” allow guilty suspects to be set free. The Supreme Court has permitted the use in trial of seized evidence that would have been “inevitably discovered” even without an unconstitutional search—such as that “in plain view”—or which police officers acquired under a search warrant that they did not know was improperly issued.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_034">The cases that established the exclusionary rule are <em class="emphasis">Weeks v. United States</em>, 232 US 383 (1914) and <em class="emphasis">Mapp v. Ohio</em>, 367 US 643 (1961). See, more recently, <em class="emphasis">Nix v.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rights of the Accused</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Collectively, the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Amendments set forth procedural guarantees known as “rights of the accused,” which exist through the criminal process from accusation to trial to conviction.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Innocent until Proven Guilty</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p01">The central right of the accused is the presumption that anyone charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty in court. This rule can be hard to preserve when an accused individual has been subjected to massive unfavorable media attention prior to or during a trial. For example, the police have perfected a technique known as the “perp walk” (for “perpetrator”), allowing television cameras to film the accused—often handcuffed and in prison garb—escorted by police. Such images, repeated over and over again in news broadcasts, can lead viewers to presume guilt rather than innocence.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p01">The Constitution’s Fifth Amendment gives people the right to refuse to answer questions from any entity of government if they claim such responses might lead to criminal prosecution. Claiming this right not to incriminate oneself is popularly called “taking the fifth.” Witnesses may be compelled to testify only if given immunity from prosecution.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_035"><em class="emphasis">Quinn v. United States</em>, 349 US 155 (1955); <em class="emphasis">Emspak v. United States</em>, 349 US 190 (1955) and <em class="emphasis">Ullman v. United States</em>, 350 US 422 (1956).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p02">Such restrictions frustrate law enforcement officers, who find confessions among the best means to obtain a guilty verdict.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p03">The right against self-incrimination originally meant only that individuals could not be forced to testify against themselves during their trials. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court threw out convictions for which evidence had been gained by torture or coercion and slowly expanded the right to cover all discussions with all law enforcement officials.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p04">By 1966, the Court was weary of issuing case-by-case decisions about whether the police had gone too far in questioning suspects. In <em class="emphasis">Miranda v. Arizona</em> (384 US 436), the justices, having reviewed numerous police manuals, concluded that police often tried to create an atmosphere designed to intimidate or manipulate the accused into confessing. The justices ruled that law enforcement officials must “demonstrate the use of procedural safeguards” by ensuring that the accused is “adequately and effectively apprised of his rights.” The Miranda decision required a warning to be read to suspects prior to interrogation—this warning is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Miranda rights</a><span class="glossdef">List of rights that the police must tell suspects if their confessions are to be admitted as evidence in court.</span></span>—without which their statements could not be admitted as evidence in court. Suspects must be notified of the following: that they have the right to remain silent, that whatever they say can be used against them in court, that they have the right to be represented by a lawyer before and during questioning, that they have the right to have a lawyer provided by the court if they cannot afford one, and that they have the right to terminate questioning at any time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p06">But are they effective? Police officers view the reading of these rights as a mere technicality. They can get information by appealing to a suspect’s desire to tell his or her story and by acting as if they are on the suspect’s side. Even after suspects invoke Miranda rights, officers can try to change their minds or elicit what they term off-the-record information. Eighty percent of suspects voluntarily waive their rights; many confess.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_036">Welsh S.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Trial Procedures</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p01">Over time, Supreme Court decisions have outlined processes for a suspect to be tried in court. The most important are the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Individuals cannot be subject to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double jeopardy</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of putting someone on trial a second time for a crime after their acquittal; prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.</span></span>; in other words, they cannot be tried again for a crime after being acquitted of it in an earlier trial. This restriction does not prevent someone acquitted in a criminal case from being sued in a civil case: actor-athlete O. J. Simpson, found not guilty of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, was found in civil court to be responsible and financially liable for their deaths.</li>
                <li>Suspects must know and understand the charges and evidence against them; therefore, cases against those “incompetent to stand trial” for reasons of illness or insanity must be dismissed, and juvenile suspects cannot be tried as adults.</li>
                <li>The trial must be speedy, so that someone not yet proven guilty is not punished by lengthy incarceration before trial.</li>
                <li>Defendants for serious crimes (punishable by more than six months in prison or a $500 fine) and those in federal civil cases have a right to a trial by an “impartial jury” of their peers.</li>
                <li>Defendants have a right to face and confront witnesses against them.</li>
                <li>The accused has a right to a defense attorney. At first, this meant only that accused persons could pay for lawyers to represent them. But the 1932 case of seven young African American men sentenced in Scottsboro, Alabama, to die on a charge of raping two white women (a charge later found to be trumped-up) persuaded the Supreme Court otherwise. The justices ruled that these defendants—poor, illiterate, and charged with a capital offense—had to be represented by a public defender, a defense attorney employed and paid by the state.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p02">This ruling gradually extended to all defendants in federal courts, then to felony defendants in state courts, and eventually to anyone facing any jail time.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_037"><em class="emphasis">Johnson v. Zerbst</em>, 304 US 458 (1938); <em class="emphasis">Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, 372 US 335 (1963) and <em class="emphasis">Argersinger v. Hamlin</em>, 407 US 25 (1972).</span> But public defenders are underpaid and overworked. And their convicted clients can win on appeal only if they can show that public defenders made serious errors, depriving them of a fair trial.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_038"><em class="emphasis">United States v. Cronic</em>, 466 US 648 (1984) and <em class="emphasis">Strickland v. Washington</em>, 466 US 668 (1984).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p03">Moreover, most charges are resolved prior to trial when a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p01">Civil liberties are often impaired during international crises. Witness the “war on terrorism,” which is no exception. While the revelations in April 2004 of abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison may be a matter more for international law than civil liberties, other rights of the accused were also in question after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p02">In October 2001, Congress enacted the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/highlights.htm">USA Patriot Act</a>. Among other things, it authorized the attorney general to detain indefinitely a noncitizen when there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that the person is a threat to national security. Attorney General John Ashcroft praised these policies, correctly observing, “It is difficult for a person in jail or under detention to murder innocent people or to aid or abet in terrorism.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_039">Quoted in Matthew Purdy, “Bush’s New Rules to Fight Terror Transform the Legal Landscape,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 25, 2001, B4.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p03">The Bush administration used these powers vigorously. Hundreds of resident aliens were detained without explanation in the fall of 2001, many in solitary confinement. When the Taliban government was overthrown in Afghanistan in late 2001, American forces captured some ten thousand soldiers and other Afghanis. Many of them were named “enemy combatants” (not “prisoners of war,” who would have greater protection under international law). Shackled and hooded, they were shipped to a military prison at the base at Guantánamo Bay. Some were subjected to abusive interrogation. The base was located on land the United States had leased from Cuba in perpetuity, and thus, according to the Bush administration, it was outside the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_040">For a detailed history of abuses in the war on terror, see Jane Mayer, <em class="emphasis">The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals</em> (New York: Doubleday, 2008); and for a critique of the trade-off between liberty and security see David Cole and Jules Lobel, <em class="emphasis">Less Safe, Less Free: Why America Is Losing the War on Terror</em> (New York: New Press, 2007).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p04">Many rights of the accused were directly challenged by these policies: the right to know charges against oneself, the right to counsel, the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to a jury of one’s peers, the right to confront adverse witnesses, and the ability to appeal decisions to a higher court.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p05">In 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the president’s power as commander in chief to name persons as enemy combatants, to hold them indefinitely under Congress’s authorization of military force, and to fashion trial proceedings with less stringent standards of evidence. But that due process required that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the detention’s basis before a neutral decision maker.

In 1972, the Supreme Court threw out all state laws imposing the death penalty as a violation of due process being arbitrarily applied from one case to the next. In 1976, the Court allowed states to impose capital punishment as long as it is decided on by a jury following a strict process, weighing mitigating and aggravating circumstances to decide if death is the most appropriate punishment.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_048"><em class="emphasis">Furman v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_s02_p02">The main objection to the death penalty today is that it cannot be applied dependably enough to meet the Bill of Rights’ standards for due process. Death sentences vary greatly based on the race of the convicted murderer and of the murder victim; blacks convicted of murdering a white person are far more likely to receive a death sentence than blacks convicted of murdering a black person (see <a class="xref" href="#paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_s02_n01">Note 4.28 "Comparing Content"</a>).</p>

For some investigative journalists, the answer is innocent death row inmates. Building on evidence dug up by journalism professor David Protess and his students at Northwestern University, reporters for the <em class="emphasis">Chicago Tribune</em> compiled two devastating series about prisoners sentenced to die on faulty evidence—“Trial and Error” and “The Failure of the Death Penalty in Illinois.” The first story in the series began by listing accusations against prosecutors: “They have prosecuted black men, hiding evidence the real killers were white.

This focus on the exoneration of the wrongfully convicted, sometimes by dramatic revelations of exculpatory DNA evidence, shifts the media’s frame away from the victims of crime to the victims of prosecution, and may thereby shift public opinion. But for the daytime talk show, the victims are survivors of violent crime who rely on the justice system to give them what Winfrey called “closure.” The future of capital punishment may depend on which frame wins.</p>

Some policies initiated by the government’s war on terror have challenged these rights. The rights of convicted criminals apply to punishment, prison terms, and the death penalty.
