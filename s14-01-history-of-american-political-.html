        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The founders of the Constitution were fearful of the rise of factions, groups in society that organize to advance a political agenda. They designed a government of checks and balances that would prevent any one group from becoming too influential. James Madison famously warned in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federalist No. 10</a><span class="glossdef">James Madison’s essay in the <em class="emphasis">Federalist Papers</em> that deals with the need to guard against the danger of factions whose interests might be at odds with those of the wider community.</span></span> of the “mischiefs of faction,” particularly a large majority that could seize control of government.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_007">Publius (James Madison), “The Federalist No. 10,” in <em class="emphasis">The Federalist</em>, ed.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Parties as Factions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p01">The first American party system had its origins in the period following the Revolutionary War. Despite Madison’s warning in Federalist No. 10, the first parties began as political factions. Upon taking office in 1789, President George Washington sought to create an “enlightened administration” devoid of political parties.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_011">John Kenneth White and Daniel M. Shea, <em class="emphasis">New Party Politics</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2000).</span> He appointed two political adversaries to his cabinet, Alexander Hamilton as treasury secretary and Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state, hoping that the two great minds could work together in the national interest. Washington’s vision of a government without parties, however, was short-lived.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p02">Hamilton and Jefferson differed radically in their approaches to rectifying the economic crisis that threatened the new nation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_012">Joseph Charles, <em class="emphasis">The Origins of the American Party System</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1956).</span> Hamilton proposed a series of measures, including a controversial tax on whiskey and the establishment of a national bank. He aimed to have the federal government assume the entire burden of the debts incurred by the states during the Revolutionary War. Jefferson, a Virginian who sided with local farmers, fought this proposition. He believed that moneyed business interests in the New England states stood to benefit from Hamilton’s plan. Hamilton assembled a group of powerful supporters to promote his plan, a group that eventually became the Federalist Party.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_013">Richard Hofstadter, <em class="emphasis">The Idea of a Party System</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">The Federalist Party originated at the national level but soon extended to the states, counties, and towns. Hamilton used business and military connections to build the party at the grassroots level, primarily in the Northeast. Because voting rights had been expanded during the Revolutionary War, the Federalists sought to attract voters to their party. They used their newfound organization for propagandizing and campaigning for candidates. They established several big-city newspapers to promote their cause, including the <em class="emphasis">Gazette of the United States</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Columbian Centinel</em>, and the <em class="emphasis">American Minerva</em>, which were supplemented by broadsheets in smaller locales. This partisan press initiated one of the key functions of political parties—articulating positions on issues and influencing public opinion.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_014">See William Nisbet Chambers, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties in a New Nation</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963).</span></p>

Jefferson urged his friend James Madison to take on Hamilton in the press, stating, “For God’s sake, my Dear Sir, take up your pen, select your most striking heresies, and cut him to pieces in the face of the public.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_015">William Nisbet Chambers, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties in a New Nation</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963), 58.</span> Madison did just that under the pen name of Helvidius. His writings helped fuel an anti-Federalist opposition movement, which provided the foundation for the Republican Party. This early Republican Party differs from the present-day party of the same name. Opposition newspapers, the <em class="emphasis">National Gazette</em> and the <em class="emphasis">Aurora</em>, communicated the Republicans’ views and actions, and inspired local groups and leaders to align themselves with the emerging party.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_016">See William Nisbet Chambers, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties in a New Nation</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963).</span> The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Whiskey Rebellion</a><span class="glossdef">In 1794, farmers on the western frontier protested against a tax on whiskey that was part of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton’s plan to eliminate the national debt; the rebellion was suppressed by an army dispatched by the newly formed national government.</span></span> in 1794, staged by farmers angered by Hamilton’s tax on whiskey, reignited the founders’ fears that violent factions could overthrow the government.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_017">Michael Schudson, <em class="emphasis">The Good Citizen</em> (New York: Free Press, 1998).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01">Political parties were first evident in presidential elections in 1796, when Federalist John Adams was barely victorious over Republican Thomas Jefferson. During the election of 1800, Republican and Federalist members of Congress met formally to nominate presidential candidates, a practice that was a precursor to the nominating conventions used today. As the head of state and leader of the Republicans, Jefferson established the American tradition of political parties as grassroots organizations that band together smaller groups representing various interests, run slates of candidates for office, and present issue platforms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_018">John Kenneth White and Daniel M. Shea, <em class="emphasis">New Party Politics</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2000).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02">The early Federalist and Republican parties consisted largely of political officeholders. The Federalists not only lacked a mass membership base but also were unable to expand their reach beyond the monied classes. As a result, the Federalists ceased to be a force after the 1816 presidential election, when they received few votes. The Republican Party, bolstered by successful presidential candidates Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, was the sole surviving national party by 1820. Infighting soon caused the Republicans to cleave into warring factions: the National Republicans and the Democratic-Republicans.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_019">Ronald P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_p01">A true political party system with two durable institutions associated with specific ideological positions and plans for running the government did not begin to develop until 1828. The Democratic-Republicans, which became the Democratic Party, elected their presidential candidate, Andrew Jackson.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p01">Parties were especially powerful in the post–Civil War period through the Great Depression, when more than 15 million people immigrated to the United States from Europe, many of whom resided in urban areas. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Party machines</a><span class="glossdef">Partisan command structures headed by bosses who exacted loyalty and services from underlings in return for jobs and favors; machines were found primarily in cities.</span></span>, cohesive, authoritarian command structures headed by bosses who exacted loyalty and services from underlings in return for jobs and favors, dominated political life in cities.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p02">Machine politics was not based on ideology, but on loyalty and group identity. The Curley machine in Boston was made up largely of Irish constituents who sought to elect their own.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_023">John Kenneth White and Daniel M. Shea, <em class="emphasis">New Party Politics</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2000).</span> Machines also brought different groups together. The tradition of parties as ideologically ambiguous umbrella organizations stems from Chicago-style machines that were run by the Daley family. The Chicago machine was described as a “hydra-headed monster” that “encompasses elements of every major political, economic, racial, ethnic, governmental, and paramilitary power group in the city.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_024">Milton Rakove, <em class="emphasis">Don’t Make No Waves, Don’t Back No Losers: An Insider’s Analysis of the Daley Machine</em> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1975), 3.</span> The idea of a “balanced ticket” consisting of representatives of different groups developed during the machine-politics era.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_025">Gerald M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p03">Because party machines controlled the government, they were able to sponsor public works programs, such as roads, sewers, and construction projects, as well as social welfare initiatives, which endeared them to their followers. The ability of party bosses to organize voters made them a force to be reckoned with, even as their tactics were questionable and corruption was rampant.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_026">A.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p05">The lasting image of the political party boss as a corrupt and greedy fat cat was the product of a relentless campaign by American political cartoonist Thomas Nast in <em class="emphasis">Harper’s Weekly</em> from 1868 to 1871. Nast’s target was William “Boss” Tweed, leader of the New York Tammany Hall party machine, who controlled the local Democratic Party for nearly a decade.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p06">Nast established the political cartoon as a powerful force in shaping public opinion and the press as a mechanism for “throwing the rascals” out of government. His cartoons ingrained themselves in American memories because they were among the rare printed images available to a wide audience in a period when photographs had not yet appeared in newspapers or magazines, and when literacy rates were much lower than today. Nast’s skill at capturing political messages in pictures presented a legacy not just for today’s cartoonists but for photographers and television journalists. His skill also led to the undoing of Boss Tweed.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p07">Tweed and his gang of New York City politicians gained control of the local Democratic Party by utilizing the Society of Tammany (Tammany Hall), a fraternal organization, as a base. Through an extensive system of patronage whereby the city’s growing Irish immigrant population was assured employment in return for votes, the Tweed Ring was able to influence the outcome of elections and profit personally from contracts with the city. Tweed controlled all New York state and city Democratic Party nominations from 1860 to 1870. He used illegal means to force the election of a governor, a mayor, and the speaker of the assembly.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p08">The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, <em class="emphasis">Harper’s Weekly</em>, reform groups, and disgruntled Democrats campaigned vigorously against Tweed and his cronies in editorials and opinion pieces, but none was as successful as Nast’s cartoons in conveying the corrupt and greedy nature of the regime. Tweed reacted to Nast’s cartoon, “Who Stole the People’s Money,” by demanding of his supporters, “Stop them damned pictures. I don’t care what the papers write about me. My constituents can’t read. But, damn it, they can see pictures.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_028">Jonathan Kandall, “Boss,” <em class="emphasis">Smithsonian Magazine</em>, February 2002, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/boss.html">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/boss.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p01">Not everyone benefited from political machines. There were some problems that machines either could not or would not deal with. Industrialization and the rise of corporate giants created great disparities in wealth. Dangerous working conditions existed in urban factories and rural coal mines. Farmers faced falling prices for their products. Reformers blamed these conditions on party corruption and inefficiency. They alleged that party bosses were diverting funds that should be used to improve social conditions into their own pockets and keeping their incompetent friends in positions of power.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s01_p01">The mugwumps, reformers who declared their independence from political parties, banded together in the 1880s and provided the foundation for the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Progressive Movement</a><span class="glossdef">Reformers who came together in the 1880s to fight party corruption and inefficiency that they felt was the legacy of party machines.</span></span>. The Progressives initiated reforms that lessened the parties’ hold over the electoral system. Voters had been required to cast color-coded ballots provided by the parties, which meant that their vote choice was not confidential. The Progressives succeeded by 1896 in having most states implement the secret ballot. The secret ballot is issued by the state and lists all parties and candidates. This system allows people to split their ticket when voting rather than requiring them to vote the party line. The Progressives also hoped to lessen machines’ control over the candidate selection process. They advocated a system of direct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary elections</a><span class="glossdef">An election that decides who will be a political party’s nominee for an office in the general election.</span></span> in which the public could participate rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">caucuses</a><span class="glossdef">Meetings held by party members to select candidates who will run for office.</span></span>, or meetings of party elites. The direct primary had been instituted in only a small number of states, such as Wisconsin, by the early years of the twentieth century. The widespread use of direct primaries to select presidential candidates did not occur until the 1970s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s01_p02">The Progressives sought to end party machine dominance by eliminating the patronage system. Instead, employment would be awarded on the basis of qualifications rather than party loyalty. The merit system, now called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil service</a><span class="glossdef">Government employment that would be awarded on the basis of qualifications rather than party loyalty.</span></span>, was instituted in 1883 with the passage of the Pendleton Act. The merit system wounded political machines, although it did not eliminate them.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_029">Charles Merriam and Harold F.

Former president Theodore Roosevelt split from the Republicans and ran as the Bull Moose Party candidate in 1912, and Robert LaFollette ran as the Progressive Party candidate in 1924. Republican William Howard Taft defeated Roosevelt, and LaFollette lost to Republican Calvin Coolidge.</p>

The New Deal placed the federal government in the pivotal role of ensuring the economic welfare of citizens. Both major political parties recognized the importance of being close to the power center of government and established national headquarters in Washington, DC.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s02_p02">An era of executive-centered government also began in the 1930s, as the power of the president was expanded.

Following in the footsteps of the extremely popular president Franklin Roosevelt, presidential candidates began to advertise their independence from parties and emphasized their own issue agendas even as they ran for office under the Democratic and Republican labels. Presidents, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, won elections based on personal, rather than partisan, appeals.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_032">James W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s03_p01">Political parties instituted a series of reforms beginning in the late 1960s amid concerns that party elites were not responsive to the public and operated secretively in so-called smoke-filled rooms. The Democrats were the first to act, forming the McGovern-Fraser Commission to revamp the presidential nominating system. The commission’s reforms, adopted in 1972, allowed more average voters to serve as delegates to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national party nominating convention</a><span class="glossdef">A convention held by political parties to select their presidential candidate and develop the party’s platform.</span></span>, where the presidential candidate is chosen. The result was that many state Democratic parties switched from caucuses, where convention delegates are selected primarily by party leaders, to primary elections, which make it easier for the public to take part. The Republican Party soon followed with its own reforms that resulted in states adopting primaries.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_033">William Crotty, <em class="emphasis">American Parties in Decline</em> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1984).</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s03_p03">Political parties are enduring organizations that run candidates for office. American parties developed quickly in the early years of the republic despite concerns about factions expressed by the founders. A true, enduring party system developed in 1828. The two-party system of Democrats and Republicans was in place before the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s03_p04">Party machines became powerful in the period following the Civil War when an influx of immigrants brought new constituents to the country. The Progressive Movement initiated reforms that fundamentally changed party operations. Party organizations were weakened during the period of executive-centered government that began during the New Deal.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_s03_p05">Reforms of the party nominating system resulted in the rise of candidate-centered politics beginning in the 1970s. The media contributes to candidate-centered politics by allowing candidates to take their message to the public directly without the intervention of parties.</p>
