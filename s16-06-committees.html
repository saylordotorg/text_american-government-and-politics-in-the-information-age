In the House, committee assignments can be a ticket to visibility and influence. Committees provide House members with a platform for attracting media attention as journalists will seek them out as policy specialists. Senate committee assignments are not as strongly linked to press visibility as virtually every senator is appointed to at least one powerful committee. The average senator serves on eleven committees and subcommittees, while the average House member serves on five.</p>

In 1955, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency staged three days of hearings in New York City as part of its investigation into allegations brought by Senator Estes Kefauver (D-TN), a subcommittee member, that violent comic books could turn children into criminals. The press-friendly hearings featured controversial speakers and slides of comic strips depicting a machine gun–toting woman character named “Frisco Mary” blowing away law enforcement officials without remorse that were circulated widely in the media. Kefauver anticipated that the press generated by these hearings would help him gain publicity for a bid to get on the 1956 Democratic presidential ticket. He lost the presidential nomination battle but ended up the vice presidential candidate for the losing side.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_029">Amy Kiste Nyberg, <em class="emphasis">Seal of Approval</em> (Oxford: University of Mississippi Press, 1998).</span></p>

They decide the fate of bills by determining which ones will move forward and be considered by the full House and Senate.

They have access to experts and information, which gives them an advantage when debating bills on the floor.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_030">Kenneth A. Shepsle and Barry R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p02">Committee chairs are especially influential, as they are able to employ tactics that can make or break bills. Powerful chairs master the committee’s subject matter, get to know committee members well, and form coalitions to back their positions. Chairs can reward cooperative members and punish those who oppose them by granting or withholding favors, such as supporting pork barrel legislation that will benefit a member’s district.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_031">Richard Fenno, <em class="emphasis">Congressmen in Committees</em> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1973).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s06_s03_p01">Conducting investigations is one of the most public activities in which congressional committees engage. During the Progressive Era of the 1890s through 1920s, members could gain the attention of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">muckraking journalists</a><span class="glossdef">Reporters in the late 1800s to early 1900s who employed an aggressive and dramatic style to expose corruption through newspaper exposés.</span></span> by holding investigative hearings to expose corruption in business and government. The first of these was the 1913 “Pujo hearings,” in which Rep. Arsene Pujo (D-LA) headed a probe of Wall Street financiers. High-profile investigations in the 1920s included an inquiry into the mismanagement of the Teapot Dome oil reserves. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Congress conducted an investigation of the stock market, targeting Wall Street once again. Newspapers were willing to devote much front-page ink to these hearings, as reports on the hearings increased newspaper readership. In 1950, Senator Kefauver held hearings investigating organized crime that drew 30 million television viewers at a time when the medium was new to American homes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_032">David R.

People in government, the labor movement, and the motion picture industry were accused of being communists. Especially sensational were hearings where Hollywood actors, directors, and writers were called before the HUAC. It was not uncommon for people in Hollywood to have joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression of the 1930s, although many were inactive at the time of the hearings. HUAC alleged that film “was the principle medium through which Communists have sought to inject their propaganda.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_035">Phillip L.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s06_s03_p05">Those accused of being communists, nicknamed “reds,” were called before the HUAC. They were subject to intense questioning by members of Congress and the committee’s counsel. In 1947, HUAC held hearings to investigate the influence of Communists in Hollywood. The “<strong class="emphasis bold">Hollywood Ten</strong>,” a group of nine screenwriters, including Ring Lardner, Jr. and Dalton Trumbo, and director Edward Dmytryk, were paraded before the committee. Members of Congress shouted to the witnesses, “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” They were commanded to provide the names of people they knew to be Communists or face incarceration. Some of the Hollywood Ten responded aggressively to the committee, not answering questions and making statements asserting their First Amendment right to free expression. Blinding flashbulbs provided a constant backdrop to the hearings, as photographers documented images of dramatic face-offs between committee members and the witnesses. Images of the hearings were disseminated widely in front-page photos in newspapers and magazines and on television.</p>

The few films made later are more critical. Woody Allen plays a small-time bookie who fronts for blacklisted writers in <em class="emphasis">The Front</em> (1976), a film depicting the personal toll exacted by the HUAC and blacklisting. In <em class="emphasis">Guilty by Suspicion</em> (1991), Robert DeNiro’s character refuses to name names and jeopardizes his career as a director. <em class="emphasis">One of the Hollywood Ten</em> (2000), graphically depicts film director Herbert Biberman’s experience in front of the HUAC before he is jailed for not cooperating.</p>
