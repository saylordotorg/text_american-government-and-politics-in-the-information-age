Parties provide an organizational structure for leaders in office, develop policy agendas, and ensure that majority and minority party opinions are voiced. The party in government seeks to represent its supporters, achieve policy objectives, and enhance the prospects for reelection. It is the center of democratic action. Party coalitions of many officeholders can be more powerful mechanisms for voicing opinions than individual leaders acting on their own. Coalitions from opposing parties spar openly by taking different positions on issues.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_052">Samuel J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s01_p01">The president is the official and symbolic leader of his party. Presidents can use this position to rally members of Congress to push their agendas as President Franklin Roosevelt did to get his New Deal programs passed quickly with the help of congressional Democrats. President Ronald Reagan mobilized congressional Republicans to enact the so-called Reagan revolution of conservative policies, such as cutting taxes and increasing defense spending. Other presidents prefer to adopt a policy of triangulation, where they work both sides of the congressional aisle.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_053">John Kenneth White and Daniel M.

President Bill Clinton made fundraising a priority for the Democratic Party. He was the headliner at major events that drew big crowds and raised millions of dollars. President George W. Bush became the top fundraiser for the Republican Party, raising a record $84 million in six months en route to achieving a $170 million goal by the 2004 presidential election.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_054">“Bush Campaign Has Raised Nearly $84 Million Since Last Spring,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, October 14, 2003.</span> During his campaign for the presidency, Barack Obama raised over $600 million mostly through online appeals. Once in office, President Obama continued to raise funds for Democratic Party candidates through appearances at dinners and events as well as through his campaign organization’s website, Organizing for America.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_055">Jose Antonio Vargas, “Obama Raised Half a Billion Online,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, November 20, 2008, accessed March 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/11/obama-raised-half-a-billion-on.html">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/11/obama-raised-half-a-billion-on.html</a>.</span></p>

The Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, the highest ranking leaders in Congress, are members of the majority party. They work closely with the majority leader, whip, chair of the policy committee, and chair of campaign committee in each body. The House and Senate minority leaders head a similar cast on the opposite side of the partisan fence. The Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference, consisting of all members elected from a party, are the internal party organizations within each house of Congress. They oversee committee assignments and encourage party discipline by asking members to vote along party lines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Party discipline can be difficult to enforce given the diversity of constituency interests and personalities in Congress. The extent to which party members are willing to vote in a block varies over time. Party unity in congressional voting rose from 40 percent in the early 1970s to 90 percent or more since 2000.</p>

The Democratic Party in Congress contains few conservatives compared to the period before 1980, when conservative southern Democrats often disagreed with the liberal and moderate members of their party. Republicans in Congress today are more united in taking conservative positions than in the past.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_056">Larry Schwab, “The Unprecedented Senate: Political Parties in the Senate after the 2000 Election,” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the Parties</em>, ed.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Divided Government</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p01">The American system of separation of powers and checks and balances devised by the framers presents some obstacles to elected officials using their party connections to wield power. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Divided government</a><span class="glossdef">A situation in which the chief executive is of a different political party from the majority in the legislature.</span></span>, which occurs when the chief executive is of a different party from the majority in the legislature, is a common occurrence in American government.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p02">President Clinton faced the challenges of divided government beginning in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House and Senate. Clinton did not use the veto power once when his Democratic Party controlled Congress between 1993 and 1994. After the Democrats lost fifty-two seats in Congress to Republicans as a result of the 1994 midterm elections, President Clinton used the veto to block legislation his party opposed, including tax bills that were central to the Republican Party’s platform. From 1995 to 2000, he vetoed thirty-six bills.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_058">Samuel B. Hoff, “Evaluating the Clinton Veto Record 1993–2001,” unpublished paper, Delaware State University, 2003.</span> Democratic President Barack Obama was faced with divided government in 2010 when the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives while the Democrats held the Senate by a small margin. Obama used the State of the Union address to call for the parties to work together on key issues, especially health care and the economy.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn10_059">Mike Dorning, “Obama Ushers in Era of Divided Government with Appeal for Unity, Progress,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg</em>, January 26, 2011, accessed March 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-26/obama-ushers-in-era-of-divided-government-with-appeal-for-unity-progress.html">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-26/obama-ushers-in-era-of-divided- government-with-appeal-for-unity-progress.html</a>.</span></p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p03">The party in government constitutes the organized partisans who serve in office, such as members of the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress. The president is the symbolic leader of his political party and can use this position to urge party members to achieve policy goals. Legislative parties seek to impose discipline on party members in Congress, which is not always easily accomplished because members represent vastly different constituencies with particular needs. Divided government—periods when the president is of a different party from the majority in Congress—can create challenges for presidents seeking to enact their policy agendas.</p>
