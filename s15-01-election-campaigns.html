    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_p02">This section covers campaign organization, funding, and strategy. Getting elected often requires defeating opponents from the same political party in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary election</a><span class="glossdef">An election that decides who will be a political party’s nominee for an office in the general election.</span></span> in order to become that party’s nominee.

Election campaigns require organization, funding, and strategy. Legal guidelines, especially for campaign finance, influence the environment within which elections take place.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Campaign Organization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">It takes the coordinated effort of a staff to run a successful campaign for office. The staff is headed by the campaign manager who oversees personnel, allocates expenditures, and develops strategy. The political director deals with other politicians, interest groups, and organizations supporting the candidate. The finance director helps the candidate raise funds directly and through a finance committee. The research director is responsible for information supporting the candidate’s position on issues and for research on the opponents’ statements, voting record, and behavior, including any vulnerabilities that can be attacked.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p02">The press secretary promotes the candidate to the news media and at the same time works to deflect negative publicity. This entails briefing journalists, issuing press releases, responding to reporters’ questions and requests, and meeting informally with journalists. As online media have proliferated, the campaign press secretary’s job has become more complicated, as it entails managing the information that is disseminated on news websites, such as blogs like the Huffington Post, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social media</a><span class="glossdef">Digital media platforms that allow users to create and share content easily and that have been used in elections to share candidate information and videos, organize events, and collect campaign donations.</span></span>, such as Facebook. Campaigns also have consultants responsible for media strategy, specialists on political advertising, and speech writers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p04">Relatedly, focus groups bring together a few people representative of the general public or of particular groups, such as undecided voters, to find out their reactions to such things as the candidate’s stump speech delivered at campaign rallies, debate performance, and campaign ads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">“Money is the mother’s milk of politics,” observed the longtime and powerful California politician Jesse Unruh. The cost of organizing and running campaigns has risen precipitously. The 2008 presidential and congressional elections cost $5.3 billion dollars, a 25 percent increase over 2004.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_002">Brody Mullins, “Cost of 2008 Election Cycle: $5.3 Billion,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 23, 2008.</span> Around 60 percent of this money goes for media costs, especially television advertising. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfinst.org">Campaign Finance Institute</a> has a wealth of information about funding of American election campaigns.</p>

The FECA also provided a system of public financing for presidential campaigns. It required that campaigns report their financial information to a newly established enforcement institution, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Elections Commission (FEC)</a><span class="glossdef">The institution that oversees campaign finance, including campaign contributions and candidate expenditures.</span></span>, which would make it public.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p03">Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these laws in the federal courts, arguing that they restrict political expression.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_004">See Bradley A. Smith, <em class="emphasis">Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001); and John Samples, <em class="emphasis">The Fallacy of Campaign Finance Reform</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).</span> In the 1976 case of <em class="emphasis">Buckley v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p04">This situation lasted for around twenty years. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“Hard money”</a><span class="glossdef">Funds, contributed directly to candidate campaigns, that are subject to government regulation.</span></span> that was contributed directly to campaigns was regulated through the FECA.

The Democratic and Republican parties raised more than $262 million in soft money in 1996, much of which was spent on advertising that came close to violating the law.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_006">Dan Froomkin, “Special Report: Campaign Finance: Overview Part 4, Soft Money—A Look at the Loopholes,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, September 4, 1998.</span></p>

Colbert testified in front of the FEC and was granted permission to form his PAC, which would be funded by Viacom, the media corporation that owns Comedy Central, which hosts <em class="emphasis">The Colbert Report</em>. The decision sparked concern that media organizations would be free to spend unlimited amounts of money in campaigns; however, the FEC’s decision imposed the strict limitation that Colbert could only show the ads on his program. Colbert announced the FEC’s decision to allow him to form a PAC to raise and spend funds in the 2012 election in this video: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/391146/june-30-2011/colbert-super-pac---i-can-haz-super-pac-">http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/391146/june-30-2011/colbert-super-pac---i-can-haz-super-pac-</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p01">There are six main sources of funding for federal elections. These sources include individuals, political action committees, public funding, candidates’ contributions to their own campaigns, political party committees, and advocacy organizations or “527 committees.” Individuals contribute the most to election campaigns. Individual donations amounted to $1,330,861,724<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_010">Campaign finance data for the 2008 campaign are available at the Federal Election Commission, “Presidential Campaign Finance: Contributions to All Candidates by State,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/mapApp.do">http://www.fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/mapApp.do</a>.</span> for the 2008 presidential election cycle. People can give up to $2,300 to candidates for each primary, runoff, and general election; $28,500 annually to national political parties and $10,000 to each state party; $2,300 to a legal compliance fund; and as much as they want to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">political action committee (PAC)</a><span class="glossdef">Funds associated with business or labor organizations or with politicians and created in order to finance candidates’ campaigns.</span></span> and advocacy organizations. PACs were developed by business and labor to fund candidates. Politicians have also created PACs. They can give up to $5,000 per candidate per election. In 2008, they gave the second-largest amount: $5,221,500.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p02">Presidential candidates can opt for public funding of their election campaigns. The funds come from an income tax check-off, where people can check a box to contribute $3 to a public funding account. To qualify for public funding, candidates must have raised $100,000 in amounts of $250 or less, with at least $5,000 from each of twenty states. The first $250 of every individual contribution is matched with public funds starting January 1 of the election year. However, candidates who take public funds must adhere to spending limits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p03">If the campaign has sufficient funds, retail politics involves <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">microtargeting</a><span class="glossdef">Use of computers and mathematical models to identify people’s vote preferences based on a variety of factors ranging from their partisan preferences to their purchasing history.</span></span>, using computers and mathematical models to identify people’s vote preferences on the bases of the magazines they read, credit card purchases, and the cars they own.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_012">Leslie Wayne, “Democrats Take Page from Their Rival’s Playbook,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 31, 2008.</span> This information is used to woo undecided voters and ensure that supporters are registered and cast their ballot.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s03_p01">Issues, subjects, and public-policy positions on matters of concern are central to campaigns. Candidates take positions on issues that are designed to increase their chances of election. Issues raised during campaigns are often based on voters’ concerns that are identified by polls. The media can make issues a prominent part of the election agenda, which can work for or against a candidate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s03_p02">Many candidates have past records indicating their stands on issues, leaving them little choice about how to manage some issues. Incumbents claim credit for their accomplishments. Challengers blame the incumbent for the country’s problems. Moreover, each party is associated with certain issues. Democrats are seen as the party to protect social security, improve the economy by creating jobs, increase the minimum wage, and expand health care coverage. Republicans are viewed as the party to strengthen national defense, cut taxes, and be tough on crime.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Staying on Message</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p01">Implementing strategy effectively requires staying on message. Candidates are like barkers at a fairground, each promoting his or her own show. At every opportunity they repeat their message, which is sometimes abbreviated into a slogan. In 1992 the main message of Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign was “It’s the economy, stupid,” which was aimed at blaming President George H. W. Bush for the country’s economic problems. Barack Obama’s campaign slogan in 2008, “Change we can believe in,” was a fresh take on a familiar call for change in American politics.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p02">Staying on message is not easy. Campaigns constantly have to react to unexpected events and to the other side’s statements and actions—all in a twenty-four-hour news cycle. They usually respond rapidly to new subjects and issues, deflecting, reframing, or exploiting them.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p03">Elections are crucial in a representative democracy like the United States. They enable people to choose their leaders and thereby influence public policy. They endow elected officials with legitimacy. There are two main types of elections: primary and general elections. Candidates from the same political party contest for the party’s nomination in primary elections. Candidates from different parties run in the general election, which decides who will take office.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p04">Campaign finance is an integral element of American elections. Individuals, PACs, public funds, political parties, candidates themselves, and 527 committees fund campaigns. Campaign finance laws have shaped the way that candidates raise and spend money in elections, especially presidential candidates who accept public funding.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p05">Candidates engage in retail politics by meeting with voters on the campaign trail. Campaigns employ strategies that take into account party identification, candidate image, issues, and message cohesion.</p>
