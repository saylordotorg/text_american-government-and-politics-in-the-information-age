    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p01">The night of the 2004 presidential election, the Associated Press (AP) released a story under the headline “2004 Not the Breakout Year for Youth Vote After All.” According to the story, “Fewer than one in 10 voters Tuesday were 18 to 24, about the same proportion of the electorate as in 2000.…A vigorous push on college campuses by both parties and national mobilization drives had raised expectations that 2004 would be the year of the youth vote.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_001">Siobahn McDonough, “2004 Not the Breakout Year for Youth Vote After All,” <em class="emphasis">Associated Press</em>, November 2, 2004.</span> The AP story implied that young voters had not turned out in the large numbers that many observers had predicted. It cited early exit polls, which are notoriously unreliable, as the basis for its conclusion. The article was reprinted in many newspapers, and it formed the basis of numerous television, radio, and online reports.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p02">The article, however, was incorrect. In fact, turnout among eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds had risen significantly from 36 percent in the 2000 presidential election to 47 percent in 2004.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_002">Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), “Youth Voting,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.civicyouth.org/?page_id=241#1">http://www.civicyouth.org/?page_id=241#1</a>.</span> Youth-vote activists and scholars acted quickly to correct the inaccuracies through the media, but it was too late. This single article had a tremendous influence on opinion leaders and political operatives. Candidates, campaign consultants, and political party leaders cited the AP article as evidence that young voters are not a constituency that is worth targeting in elections.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_003">Diana Owen, <em class="emphasis">Youth Voting and the Media</em> (Washington, DC: George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p03">The AP story was the first to come out on the youth vote following the election, which gave it particular prominence. More importantly, the article reinforced existing stereotypes of young voters held by elites and journalists. It employed the standard “apathetic youth voter” frame that journalists have used for decades when covering young voters. This frame reflects conventional beliefs that young voters are less likely to turn out in campaigns than older voters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p04">The “apathetic youth voter” frame is so entrenched in political and journalistic lore that it is difficult to refute, even when evidence is to the contrary. The assumptions underlying this media frame were challenged again during the 2008 presidential campaign, as young people were a visible and active force in the election, and turnout increased from 2004. Still, postelection stories in 2008 perpetuated the myth of the “apathetic youth voter.” The <em class="emphasis">Florida Sentinel</em> proclaimed, “Young people are turning out in disproportionately low numbers.” Even the <em class="emphasis">Daily Tar Heel</em>, a college newspaper, reported, “The expected youth surge didn’t exactly pan out.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p05">The “apathetic youth voter” frame focuses on elections, but it typifies the media’s dominant image of the American public, which is portrayed as politically disengaged, alienated, disinterested, and uninformed. Media images of the general public’s political involvement are unflattering, but depictions of young people are worse. Mainstream media portray young people as irresponsible, self-centered, and lacking the motivation to become involved in government and politics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p06">Media representations of the public’s political disengagement contain elements of truth. Americans do not meet the ideal of involved and fully informed citizens that derives from the concept of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">New England town meeting</a><span class="glossdef">A form of direct democratic participation as characterized by meetings of entire communities in New England during the colonial period.</span></span> of the colonial period where the entire community took part in civic affairs. Media coverage focuses on the particular aspects of political participation that typically have low rates of civic engagement—especially political party work and campaign activity—or on the aspects that are expected to have higher rates of engagement, such as voting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p07">The public is more politically active and aware than much press coverage would suggest. Over 50 percent of adults have joined political organizations and more than 70 percent of young people have done community service.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_004">Michael Schudson, <em class="emphasis">The Good Citizen</em> (New York: Free Press, 1998).</span> Still, the “engaged public” remains a largely untold news story.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s00_p08">Americans participate in politics in many different ways, such as voting, contacting leaders, holding public office, and protesting. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social movements</a><span class="glossdef">Large groups of people with common concerns who have mobilized to actively pursue political objectives.</span></span> that mobilize large numbers of people on behalf of a cause are an important dimension of American political involvement. This chapter examines the origins, development, and influence of social movements. The media’s depiction of citizens’ political participation is complex and even contradictory.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_p01">After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Americans have many options for taking part in politics, including voting, contacting public officials, campaigning, running for and holding office, protesting, and volunteering. Voting is the most prominent form of political participation. Voter registration and turnout is influenced by legal and structural factors, voter qualifications, the type of election, and voters’ enthusiasm about a particular campaign.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Political Participation</h2>

They can take part in organizations that work to directly influence policies made by government officials. They can communicate their interests, preferences, and needs to government by engaging in public debate.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_006">Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, and Henry E. Brady, <em class="emphasis">Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995).</span> Such political activities can support government officials, institutions, and policies, or aim to change them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">Far more people participate in politics by voting than by any other means. Yet there are many other ways to take part in politics that involve varying amounts of skill, time, and resources. People can work in an election campaign, contact public officials, circulate a petition, join a political organization, and donate money to a candidate or a cause. Serving on a local governing or school board, volunteering in the community, and running for office are forms of participation that require significant time and energy. Organizing a demonstration, protesting, and even rioting are other forms of participation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_007">Lester W. Milbrath and M. L. Goel, <em class="emphasis">Political Participation</em>, 2nd ed. (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1977).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p03">People also can take part in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">support activities</a><span class="glossdef">Passive forms of politics involvement, such as attending a concert on behalf of a cause.</span></span>, more passive forms of political involvement. They may attend concerts or participate in sporting events associated with causes, such as the “Race for the Cure” for breast cancer. These events are designed to raise money and awareness of societal problems, such as poverty and health care. However, most participants are not activists for these causes. Support activities can lead to active participation, as people learn about issues through these events and decide to become involved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p04">People also can engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">symbolic participation</a><span class="glossdef">Routine or habitual acts that show support for or dissatisfaction with the political system.</span></span>, routine or habitual acts that show support for the political system.

Symbolic acts are not always supportive of the political system. Some people may refuse to say the pledge of allegiance to express their dissatisfaction with government. Citizens can show their unhappiness with leadership choices by the symbolic act of not voting.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Voting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p01">For many people, voting is the primary means of taking part in politics. A unique and special political act, voting allows for the views of more people to be represented than any other activity. Every citizen gets one vote that counts equally. Over 90 percent of Americans agree with the principle that citizens have a duty to vote.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_008">William H. Flanigan and Nancy H. Zingale, <em class="emphasis">Political Behavior of the American Electorate</em>, 9th ed. (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 1999).</span> Still, many people do not vote regularly.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Voter Qualifications</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p01">Registered voters meet eligibility requirements and have filed the necessary paperwork that permits them to vote in a given locality. In addition to the requirement that voters must be eighteen years of age, states can enforce residency requirements that mandate the number of years a person must live in a place before being eligible to vote. A large majority of people who have registered to vote participate in presidential elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p02">The composition of the electorate has changed radically throughout American history. The pool of eligible voters has expanded from primarily white, male property owners at the founding to include black men after the Civil War, women after 1920, and eighteen- to twenty-year-olds after 1971. The eligible electorate in the 1800s, when voter turnout consistently exceeded 70 percent, was far different than the diverse pool of eligible voters today.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Barriers to Voting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p01">Social, cultural, and economic factors can keep people from voting. Some barriers to voting are informal. The United States holds a large number of elections, and each is governed by specific rules and schedules. With so many elections, people can become overwhelmed, confused, or just plain tired of voting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p02">Other barriers are structural. Voter registration laws were implemented in the 1860s by states and big cities to ensure that only citizens who met legal requirements could vote. Residency requirements limited access to registration offices. Closing voting rosters weeks or months in advance of elections effectively disenfranchised voters. Over time, residency requirements were relaxed. Beginning in the 1980s, some states, including Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, made it possible for people to register on Election Day. Turnout in states that have Election Day registration averages ten points higher than in the rest of the country.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_009">Raymond E. Wolfinger and Steven J. Rosenstone, <em class="emphasis">Who Votes?</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1980).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p03">The United States is one of the few democracies that requires citizens to register themselves rather than having the government take responsibility for automatically registering them. Significant steps have been taken to make registration easier. In 1993, Congress passed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">National Voter Registration Act</a><span class="glossdef">A law that allows citizens to register to vote at motor vehicle and social services offices; also known as the “motor voter” law.</span></span>, also known as the “motor voter” law, allowing citizens to register at motor vehicle and social service offices. “Motor voter’s” success in increasing the ranks of registered voters differs by state depending on how well the program is publicized and executed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p04">Voter registration also has been assisted by online registration. In most cases, individuals must download the form, sign it, and mail it in. Rock the Vote (RTV), a nonpartisan youth mobilization organization, established the first online voter registration initiative in 1992 with official backing from the Congressional Internet Caucus. RTV registered over 2 million new voters in 1992, 80 percent of whom cast a ballot, and signed up over 2.5 million voters in 2008.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_010">“The Campaign: Rockers and Rappers,” <em class="emphasis">The Economist</em>, June 20, 1993, 25.</span> Following the 2008 election, RTV lobbied the Obama administration to institute fully automated online voter registration nationally.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Disenfranchisement of Felons</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03_p01">In all states except Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, inmates serving time for committing felonies lose their right to vote. At least ten states prohibit former felons from voting even after they have served their time. States argue that their legal authority to deny convicted felons voting rights derives from the Fourteenth Amendment, which stipulates that voting rights of individuals guilty of “participation in rebellion, or other crime” can be denied. This practice excludes almost 4 million people from the voting rolls.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_011">Human Rights Watch and the Sentencing Project, <em class="emphasis">Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws</em> (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2000).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03_p02">Opinions are divided on this issue. Some people believe that individuals who have committed a serious crime should be deprived of the privileges enjoyed by law-abiding people. Others contend that the integrity of the democratic process is at stake and that individuals should not be denied a fundamental right once they have served their time.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Turnout</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p01">Voter turnout depends on the type of election. A large number of elections are held in the United States every year, including local elections, elections for county and statewide offices, primaries, and general elections. Only a small number of people, generally under one-quarter of those eligible, participate in local, county, and state elections. Midterm elections, in which members of Congress run for office in nonpresidential-election years, normally draw about one-third of eligible voters.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_012">Steven J. Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen, <em class="emphasis">Mobilization, Participation, and Democracy in America</em> (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1993), 1.</span> Voter turnout in presidential elections is generally higher than for lower-level contests; usually more than half the eligible voters cast a ballot.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p02">Much is made about low levels of voter turnout for presidential elections in the current era. However, there have not been great fluctuations in turnout since the institution of universal suffrage in 1920. Forty-nine percent of the voting-age public cast a ballot in the 1924 presidential contest, the same percentage as in 1996. Turnout in presidential elections in the 1960s was over 60 percent. More voters were mobilized during this period of political upheaval in which people focused on issues of race relations, social welfare, and the Vietnam War.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_013">Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward, <em class="emphasis">Why Americans Still Don’t Vote</em> (Boston: Beacon Press, 2000).</span> Turnout was lower in the 1980s and 1990s, when the political climate was less tumultuous. There has been a steady increase in turnout since the 2000 presidential election, in which 51 percent of the voting-age public cast a ballot. Turnout was 55 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2008, when 132,618,580 people went to the polls.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_014">Michael McDonald, “Voter Turnout,” <em class="emphasis">United States Election Project</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm">http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p03">Turnout varies significantly across localities. Some regions have an established culture of political participation. Local elections in small towns in New England draw up to 80 percent of qualified voters. Over 70 percent of Minnesota voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election compared with 51 percent in Hawaii and West Virginia.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_015">Michael McDonald, “Voter Turnout,” <em class="emphasis">United States Election Project</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm">http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p04">Turnout figures can be skewed by undercounting the vote. This problem gained attention during the 2000 election. The contested vote in the Florida presidential race resulted in a recount in several counties. Ballots can be invalidated if they are not properly marked by voters or are not read by antiquated voting machines. Political scientists have determined that presidential election turnout is underestimated on average by 4 percent, which translates into hundreds of thousands of votes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_016">William H.

Voter turnout levels have hovered around 40 percent in the past three midterm elections.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p01">Expressing opinions about leaders, issues, and policies has become one of the most prominent forms of political participation. The number of people contacting public officials at all levels of government has risen markedly over the past three decades. Seventeen percent of Americans contacted a public official in 1976. By 2008, 44 percent of the public had contacted their member of Congress about an issue or concern.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_019">Congressional Management Foundation, <em class="emphasis">Communicating with Congress: How the Internet Has Changed Citizen Engagement</em> (Washington, DC: Congressional Management Foundation, 2008).</span> E-mail has made contacting public officials cheaper and easier than the traditional method of mailing a letter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p02">Students interning for public officials soon learn that answering constituent mail is one of the most time-consuming staff jobs.

Riots are frequently spontaneous and are sparked by an incident that brings to a head deep-seated frustrations and emotions. Members of social movements may resort to rioting when they perceive that there are no conventional alternatives for getting their message across. Riots can result in destruction of property, looting, physical harm, and even death. Racial tensions sparked by a video of police beating Rodney King in 1991 and the subsequent acquittal of the officers at trial resulted in the worst riots ever experienced in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p03">In March 1991, KTLA News at Ten in Los Angeles interrupted programming to broadcast an eighty-one-second amateur videotape of several police officers savagely beating black motorist Rodney King as he stood next to his vehicle. A nineteen-second edit of the tape depicted the most brutal police actions and became one of the most heavily broadcast images in television news history. The original and the edited tape tell two different stories of the same event.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p04">Viewing the entire tape, one would have seen a belligerent and violent Rodney King who was difficult for police to constrain. Not filmed at all was an intoxicated King driving erratically, leading police on an eight-mile, high-speed chase through crowded streets.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p05">The edited video showing the beating of King told a different story of police brutality and was the basis of much controversy. Race relations in Los Angeles in 1991 were strained. The tape enraged blacks in Los Angeles who saw the police actions as being widespread within the Los Angeles Police Department and not an isolated incident.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p06">Four white officers were tried in criminal court for the use of excessive force, and they were acquitted of all but one charge. Jurors were shown the entire tape, not just the famous nineteen-second clip. Soon after the verdict was announced, riots broke out. Demonstrators burned buildings and assaulted bystanders. Fifty-four people were killed and two thousand were wounded. Property damage was in the millions of dollars.</p>

Today, students demonstrate to draw attention to causes. They make use of new communications technologies to organize protests by forming groups on the Internet. Online strategies have been used to organize demonstrations against the globalization policies of the World Trade Organization and the World Bank. Over two hundred websites were established to rally support for protests in Seattle, Washington; Washington, DC; Quebec City, Canada; and other locations. Protest participants received online instructions at the protest site about travel and housing, where to assemble, and how to behave if arrested. Extensive e-mail listservs keep protestors and sympathizers in contact between demonstrations. Twitter, a social messaging platform that allows people to provide short updates in real time, has been used to convey eyewitness reports of protests worldwide. Americans followed the riots surrounding the contested presidential election in Iran in 2009 on Twitter, as observers posted unfiltered, graphic details as the violent event unfolded.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">People’s integration into their communities is strongly related to their level of political activity. Those who are mobile and have not established community roots find it more difficult to participate in politics because they are not part of a social network. It takes about three to five years to develop friendship networks, learn about the problems facing a community, and identify which people are the key players.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_033">M.

President Bill Clinton pardoned Dorothy Gaines and Kemba Smith, who had received long mandatory prison sentences on drug charges with no hope of parole. They were not involved with drugs but had boyfriends who were dealers. It is a crime under federal law to associate with known drug dealers. Ms. Gaines lobbied for her freedom from her jail cell, working with civil rights organizations, and she drew media attention to her problem, including a widely read article in <em class="emphasis">People</em> magazine. Kemba Smith’s father, Gus, an accountant who had never been politically active, worked to secure his daughter’s release. A cover story in <em class="emphasis">Ebony</em> magazine rallied support for her case, and a film was made about her life. Since the pardons, Dorothy Gaines, her father, and Kemba Smith have continued to lobby for changes in the sentencing laws. Kemba Smith has established a foundation to educate young people about making proper decisions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p02">Americans’ interest in politics had declined for about two decades beginning in the 1980s. Only about one-quarter of the public in 2000 expressed much interest in the presidential campaign, and there was even less interest in other aspects of politics. Only about 40 percent of citizens felt strongly that voting was an important civic duty. The 2008 presidential campaign bucked this trend: around 80 percent of the public expressed interest in the election and over 60 percent considered voting to be their civic duty. Americans are typically less interested in nonpresidential elections. Forty-three percent of the public claimed to be interested in the 2010 congressional midterm elections.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_035">Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, “Pew Weekly News Interest Index Poll, Oct, 2010,” <em class="emphasis">Poll Database</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://people-press.org/questions/?qid=1772828&amp;pid=51&amp;ccid=51#top">http://people-press.org/questions/?qid=1772828&amp;pid=51&amp;ccid=51#top</a>: “Thinking about this year’s (2010) Congressional elections, would you say that you are interested in what’s happening in elections around the country?”</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p03">Political interest has been bolstered by the ability of people to take part in politics and express their opinions more easily through digital media. People feel like they have a greater say in government and can reach out to leaders through e-mail and online discussion forums. Political leaders have established social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to share information and to enable greater interaction with their constituents. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/uspolitics">“U.S. Politics on Facebook”</a> provides a gateway to the pages of politicians, elected officials, and political campaigns.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p01">The expectation that political participation will be rewarding can spark people to become active. Some people are motivated by the belief that they will be connected to powerful leaders and receive material benefits, such as a chance to further their careers or get help with a personal problem. Others embrace the opportunities to meet people and socialize while working together, or they are happy to do something good for the community. High schools and colleges throughout the nation have instituted community service programs to stimulate lifelong participation based on the personal gratification students experience when they realize that their efforts make a difference.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p02">People often are motivated to participate in politics because they are targets of mobilization efforts by political parties and interest groups. They also can acquire the habit of participating politically through the process of political socialization or have a life experience that prompts them to act. Political attitudes such as civic duty and a sense of political efficacy can influence a person’s decision to participate. People may seek personal gratification through political action, as they enjoy working with others and helping their community. Legal factors such as voter registration requirements can impede participation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">Meaningful and regular opportunities for all people to participate must be guaranteed by a democratic political system, whether or not everyone chooses to take part. But not all Americans take part in politics, nor are the opportunities for participation equal. Voters and political activists generally are older, more educated, and better off financially than the general population. These people have the best chance of having their views represented in government. Meanwhile, those who rely the most on government programs and policies, such as recipients of public assistance, often have fewer opportunities to participate and are less engaged.</p>

Wealthier and better educated people tend to vote more often, participate more in political activities, and donate more money to causes than poorer or less educated people. They also have greater access to the resources that facilitate political activity, including contacts with people in powerful positions. People’s occupations also are related to their participation, as people in managerial and professional positions are the most politically active, followed by craftspersons, service workers, and laborers. Many managers and professionals follow politics as part of their jobs. The unemployed are the least inclined to take part.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p02">Education has the strongest impact on participation, as it provides people with background knowledge of how the political system works. Educated people develop the skills that allow them to follow and understand events through the mass media. They are likely to form opinions about political issues and engage in discussions. The political blogs with the most readers, such as Daily Kos and Huffington Post, are written and read by well-educated people.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_036">Matthew Hindman, <em class="emphasis">The Myth of Digital Democracy</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008).</span> Education prepares people to deal with the bureaucratic aspects of participation, such as registering to vote or organizing a petition drive.

People between the ages of thirty-five and sixty-five are the most politically active. At this stage in life, people are more likely than younger people to have established homes, hold steady jobs, and be settled into communities.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p02">While younger people turn out in elections less often than older people, youth voting has been on the rise in presidential elections since 2004.

Sixty-six percent of women cast a ballot in 2008 compared with 62 percent of men. Women have a strong sense of civic duty and believe that voting is a citizen’s obligation.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_p02">Thus far our discussion has focused primarily on how and why individuals decide to participate in politics by engaging in activities such as voting or running for office. There are times when groups of people who are concerned about a particular issue or idea join forces to demand government action. A social movement is formed when large numbers of people organize and mobilize to actively pursue common political objectives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_048">Jo Freeman and Victoria Johnson, eds., <em class="emphasis">Waves of Protest</em> (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_p03">A social movement has a formal and enduring organizational structure as well as recognized leaders. Movements begin with people who share concerns about long-standing societal problems and believe that their rights and interests are not being adequately represented. They can evolve from grassroots groups into national organizations and even become interest groups that lobby government officials. Social movements can last for months, years, or even decades. The farmworkers’ movement was founded in the 1960s by César E. Chávez and still exists today. Its national organization, the United Farm Workers, seeks congressional legislation to guarantee fair wages and treatment of undocumented workers.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_049">United Farm Workers of America, “Action Alert!

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p02">Guaranteeing the right to vote to all citizens has been the focus of some of the most important social movements. The Constitution at the time of the founding guaranteed suffrage only to white, male landowners. States placed restrictions on voting based on race, age, sex, religion, and even personal character. All states had dropped the requirement for land ownership by 1844, but constitutional restrictions based on race remained until 1870 and sex until 1920.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Civil Rights Movement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p01">The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution formally ended race-based limitations on voting in 1870. However, minority citizens were not truly enfranchised until the passage of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a><span class="glossdef">Legislation passed by the US Congress with the goal of guaranteeing African Americans equal rights under the law.</span></span> and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This legislation was the result of pressure on the government by the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p02">The civil rights movement emerged in the 1950s in reaction to discrimination against African Americans in Southern states. Segregationist policies placed restrictions on black citizens’ right to vote and violated their basic civil rights in other ways. African Americans were forced to use facilities separate from whites, such as restrooms and water fountains, and to sit at the back of public buses. Black students attended schools that were usually inferior to schools for whites.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p03">United under the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, black churches formed one foundation of the civil rights movement. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the movement’s leaders, emphasized that nonviolent direct action would be used to expose racial injustices. Civil rights activists boycotted businesses that employed discriminatory practices. They engaged in acts of civil disobedience that disrupted established patterns of daily life. Blacks ate at white lunch counters, were arrested, and jailed. Southern blacks mounted large-scale voter registration drives. In the summer of 1963 alone, over fourteen hundred demonstrations and marches were staged to protest disenfranchisement and other forms of discrimination.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p04">These tactics were designed to attract media attention that would help to galvanize the movement and force political leaders to take notice, and they worked. Politicians perceived that black voters were becoming powerful and listened to their demands. President John F. Kennedy agreed to sponsor legislation that would ensure black civil and voting rights, which Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed into law after Kennedy’s assassination.</p>

King was joined by thousands of protesters from across the nation participating in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p06">King delivered the stirring keynote speech extemporaneously. The backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial dramatized the fact that a century after the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed, freeing the slaves, blacks were still crippled by segregation and discrimination. King uttered the famous words, “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’”</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p07">The speech was covered on television in its entirety and received widespread attention in newspapers and magazines.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s02_p01">Throughout much of American history, a woman was considered to be an extension of her husband and, as such, did not need her own vote. Women were not granted the constitutional right to vote until 1920, but they were politically involved. Women formed charitable institutions to fight poverty and were active in reform movements, such as protecting children working in factories and textile mills. They participated in abolitionist groups that formed in the 1830s to achieve suffrage for slaves. Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were denied voting rights as delegates to a worldwide antislavery convention in London. This event compelled them to organize the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">women’s movement</a><span class="glossdef">A social movement that began with the goal of seeking women’s suffrage and extended to other aspects of women’s equality.</span></span> in the United States with the primary goal of gaining the fundamental right to vote.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s02_p02">Women acquired organizing skills that were central to their movement from their involvement with other causes. They lobbied Congress and state legislatures, spoke passionately in public forums, held rallies, circulated petitions, and even went to jail for their beliefs. The Nineteenth Amendment, ratified in 1920, granted woman suffrage.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s03_p01">Following in the footsteps of the civil rights movement and the women’s movement, other movements have formed in reaction to policies that disadvantage particular segments of society. The gay rights movement has succeeded in having policies enacted to fight discrimination in the workplace, increase access to medical benefits, and stop bullying in schools. Disabled Americans formed a movement that resulted in the passage of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a><span class="glossdef">Legislation passed by the US Congress guaranteeing that no individual will be excluded from the benefits of any program or activity that received public funding because of a handicap.</span></span> of 1990 guaranteeing that no individual will be excluded from the benefits of any program or activity receiving public funding because of a handicap.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s03_p03">Social movements can employ tactics to reverse the law or to challenge outcomes using extralegal, illegal, and even violent means. Antiabortion activists who seek legislation making abortions illegal have bombed clinics and attacked and even killed doctors who perform abortions. Self-described “ecoterrorists” have set fire to housing developments that they see as contributing to suburban sprawl.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s03_p04">Some movements invoke the Constitution as a justification for violent action against the government.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Movements and the Media</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Social movements rely on media attention to gain public support, recruit members, and present their agendas to political leaders. The media can shape the public’s views about particular movements and the causes they represent. Movement leaders attempt to gain control over their message through interviews and staged events.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">The press can influence a movement’s success or failure. The 1960s student movement provides an illustration. At first the student movement was virtually ignored by the media. As the Vietnam War escalated, students expressed their opposition through demonstrations and sit-ins on college campuses. Media coverage was abundant and favorable. News stories about student activists along with graphic televised images of the war helped attract new members to the antiwar effort. Press coverage became more negative as government officials who opposed the antiwar movement emerged and were featured in media reports. Negative coverage galvanized the movement, as supporters rallied to defend the cause. It also radicalized the movement, as members pursued more militant tactics to ensure coverage. The bombing of a building at the University of Wisconsin, which killed a graduate student, caused people to lose sympathy with the activists. Journalists grew tired of the story and portrayed the movement as factionalized into different groups with rival leaders. The student movement eventually fell apart.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_054">Todd Gitlin, <em class="emphasis">The Whole World Is Watching</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">The Tea Party is a loosely organized grassroots political movement formed in February 2009, whose members advocate reduced government spending, lower taxes, and a strict interpretation of the US Constitution. The organization borrows its name from the Boston Tea Party, an incident in 1773 in which colonists protested against the British government tax on tea by throwing tea imported by ships into the Boston Harbor. The Tea Party lacks a clear leader or centralized organization and is composed of more than fourteen hundred localized groups. The media have made it possible for the Tea Party to gain national attention and develop a sizable following that contributed to Tea Party candidates’ winning elections in 2010. Major news outlets publicized Tea Party protests against taxes and health care reform, especially as their lively rallies and colorful front persons, including former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, made for good copy. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://teapartypatriots.ning.com">Tea Party Patriots</a> website provides an online community organization for the movement.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">America has a long tradition of social movements wherein people work collectively for a cause. Movements have sought equal rights for women, members of racial and ethnic groups, and lesbian and gay citizens. They have worked to create better opportunities for people with disabilities and senior citizens. Social movements rely on collective action that brings individuals together to work toward a joint goal. The media are important for attracting attention to these efforts, which can increase participation in the movement and force political leaders to take notice.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">The media are central to political participation and mobilization. The public uses all forms of media to express opinions, contact leaders, and engage in politics. Journalists, pollsters, and political consultants create media depictions of peoples’ participation and inactivity. These depictions shape the public’s perceptions about political participation. Individuals may be prompted to engage in public affairs when they view media accounts of people like themselves taking part. The public can participate in politics through media, especially via the Internet and digital platforms.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Interactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p01">The interaction between media and political participation is complicated. Media can encourage or discourage participation by drawing attention to political leaders, events, and issues. New media, in particular, not only allow people to monitor politics but also provide them with options for active engagement.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Participation through Media</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_s01_p01">Americans rely on newspapers, television, radio, and online media to stay informed about politics. Media connect people to political events, such as election campaigns and rallies on the National Mall in Washington, DC, to which they may have limited direct, personal contact.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_s01_p02">People also can actively take part in politics through media. Television and radio call-in talk shows and Internet chat rooms accommodate political discussion between the public, political activists, government leaders, and the press. Right-wing talk-show host Rush Limbaugh not only encourages his listeners to sound off on air but also urges them to contact government officials, circulate political newsletters in their towns, and hold rallies and bake sales to raise funds for conservative causes. Many television and radio call-in shows accommodate predominantly callers who agree with the host. Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Sean Hannity host programs that appeal to conservative audiences. Fewer call-in programs are hosted by political liberals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_s01_p03">Televised town meetings allow the public to ask questions directly of politicians and journalists. In June 2009, ABC programmed a day of news about health care, culminating in a “town-hall meeting” with President Barack Obama titled “Prescription for America,” in which he took questions from concerned citizens. During election campaigns, televised presidential debates that allow voters, rather than journalists, to ask questions draw the largest audiences. People see others like themselves taking part in political life through media depictions, which can make them more likely to become engaged. In 2007, candidates running for the Democratic and Republican Party nominations participated in YouTube debates, in which citizens submitted their questions via video.</p>

National media attention can prompt leaders to take activists seriously. Coverage of the 1999 shootings at Colorado’s Columbine High School, which left fifteen people dead, rallied support for tougher gun-control legislation. In the wake of the Columbine shootings, students from across the state formed SAFE—Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic. A ninety-person SAFE delegation traveled in August 1999 to Washington, DC, where they met with President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) who pledged support for the group’s position advocating tougher gun-control laws. In a made-for-media moment on the steps of Capitol Hill, the students grilled members of Congress who opposed tough gun-control legislation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_055">Michael Grunwald, “At Capitol, Young Friends and Foe of Gun Control Test Each Other, <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, July 19, 1999, A10.</span></p>

Digital tools, such as websites, blogs, e-mail lists, and social network sites, can be used to organize people online. These tools can be used to spread information, recruit participants, and provide logistical information about events. People who are geographically dispersed can share stories and strategies that provide incentives for engagement.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_p01">This chapter opened with an anecdote that illustrates a dominant theme of media coverage—that the public does not participate very much in politics, especially voting. While such depictions are not entirely inaccurate, the media’s emphasis on the disengaged public is misleading. Voter turnout in presidential elections has been on the rise. Americans are contacting public officials in record numbers, joining issue organizations, and participating in community service activities. Reporting that emphasizes the public’s disengagement can discourage people from taking part in politics. On the other hand, reports that highlight the ways that people participate can spark political interest and engagement.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Media Stereotypes and Political Participation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_s01_p01">The media employ a number of stock frames in their stories about political participation. These frames generate stereotypes of the public’s participation that are at best partially accurate. Stereotypes assume that all members of the group share the same political orientations, but often this is not the case.</p>
            <div class="figure medium editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_s01_f01">

                <p class="para">The news media often try to identify a swing voter group that will be key to an election campaign. Sometimes, their choices say more about the demographics of their audiences (or even of their reporters) than about the impact on the election.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_s01_p02">The media use stereotypes in their campaign reporting to characterize groups of voters. Media attention focused on the “angry voter” for almost two decades beginning in the 1980s. At first, it was “angry white males” who emerged in response to political correctness. By the 1990s, the focus had shifted to “soccer moms” who were portrayed as being disgusted with politics. Yet studies showed that most white males and soccer moms were not upset about politics and that they did not vote as a bloc. During the 2008 campaign, the press highlighted McCain and Obama’s outreach to “NASCAR dads,” who were portrayed as a rowdy, beer guzzling crowd with lower levels of education and income than other voters. In fact, NASCAR fans’ socioeconomic status mirrors that of the general population, and they hail from all walks of life.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_056">Liz Clarke, <em class="emphasis">One Helluva Ride</em> (New York: Villard, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_s01_p03">Stereotyping has implications for political participation and policymaking. Stereotypes can form the basis of campaign and policy agendas. The media give the impression that the votes and opinions of “angry white males” who saw taxes and defense as priority issues, and “soccer moms” who were concerned about child care and education, count more than those of other people. As a result, candidates and political leaders may direct more of their attention toward this issue. Media stereotypes legitimate the ideas and causes of particular groups, while discounting those of others.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_057">Barbara L. Poole and Melinda A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p01">Scholars disagree about the effects of mass media on political participation. Some argue that the media serve the public by providing information that stimulates political interest, furthers information gathering, and encourages participation. The result is a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">virtuous circle</a><span class="glossdef">Political interest and engagement stimulated by the media.</span></span>” that promotes political engagement.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_058">Pippa Norris, <em class="emphasis">A Virtuous Circle: Political Communications in Postindustrial Societies</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003).</span> During the 2008 presidential election, the media stimulated public interest with its campaign coverage that incorporated voters’ voices through innovated new media, such as blogs and amateur video reports. Others contend that the media’s scandal-ridden and negative coverage of government and politics creates a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spiral of cynicism</a><span class="glossdef">A cycle of distrust of government and politics created by the media’s scandal-ridden coverage of government and politics.</span></span>” by generating public distrust, discouraging interest, eroding attention to the news, and ultimately hindering participation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_059">Joseph Cappella and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, <em class="emphasis">Spiral of Cynicism: The Press and the Public Good</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997).</span> Public opinion about government fell in the wake of the nonstop coverage of President Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Neither of these perspectives alone tells the full story, as both positive and negative media effects can result depending on coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p02">The media, in some instances, may have no effect on participation. People may not pay attention to political media or take media messages seriously. They assess politics on the basis of their own personal experiences or those of their families and friends. The decision to participate is related to their membership in groups and social networks, being contacted by a political party or interest group, or a sense of civic duty and efficacy. Thus some individuals’ participation or inaction is influenced by their personal realities rather than mediated realities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p03">Some scholars contend that the media create a situation wherein passive monitoring of politics substitutes for real action.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_060">Roderick P.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p06">The historic election of an African American president, Barack Obama, has energized a new generation of civil rights activists. Young people have become active in organizations whose membership was aging and their ranks dwindling. They have sought to keep the momentum of the election alive by organizing around issues, taking part in community affairs, and seeking positions in government and public affairs.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p07">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded in 1909 and is the nation’s largest grassroots civil rights organization. The average age of NAACP members is fifty-five years old. The NAACP sought to revitalize its mission and membership on the coattails of the Obama election by ramping up its youth movement. The organization has seen a rise in the number of chapters on college campuses throughout the country. Young people also have activated more than six hundred “youth units” to carry out a campaign to increase college access and affordability.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p08">Demar Lamont Roberts, a recent graduate of South Carolina State University in his twenties, became active in the NAACP to experience “the camaraderie, seeing civil rights persons that have come before me and paved the way for me.” He attended the 2009 NAACP national convention in Las Vegas so that he could interact with young people like himself who are passionate about social justice issues. He joined the leadership of the NAACP National Youth Work Committee, which is mobilizing around voting rights and other issues. Roberts used the social messaging platform Twitter to keep friends and associates informed about the convention.
