    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_p03">The process of making laws involves complex written rules and procedures, some of which date back to 1797, when Vice President Thomas Jefferson prepared a rule book to help him carry out his responsibilities as president of the Senate. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Jefferson’s Manual</a><span class="glossdef">The rule book developed by Vice President Thomas Jefferson in 1799 to help carry out his responsibilities as president of the Senate that also was adopted by the House.</span></span> was adopted by the House and remains the authoritative statement of rules except where it has been superseded by provisions passed by members.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p01">The textbook legislative process begins when a member of the House or Senate introduces a bill, which then is referred to appropriate committees within each body. Committees decide whether or not a bill is recommended for floor action, where it will be debated and voted on. The House and Senate must pass identical versions of a bill before it can be sent to the president to be signed into law.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p02">Few bills are passed via the organized, step-by-step, textbook process. Since the 1970s, “unorthodox lawmaking” has become the norm.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_s01_p01">Members develop ideas for legislation from myriad sources. Most often, proposals stem from campaign promises and issues germane to members’ districts brought to their attention by constituents and lobbying groups.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_041">John V. Sullivan, <em class="emphasis">How Our Laws Are Made</em>, research report (Washington, DC: Thomas Online, 2008), accessed May 21, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/lawsmade.bysec/foreword.html">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/lawsmade.bysec/foreword.html</a>.</span> Senator Warren Magnuson (D-WA) initiated a spate of legislation that led to the establishment of the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the 1970s after being shown an X ray of shrapnel embedded in a constituent’s skull resulting from an accident involving a power lawn mower.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_042">Eric Redman, <em class="emphasis">The Dance of Legislation</em> (Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 2001).</span> Political parties may encourage members to develop legislative initiatives that support their agendas. Members may see a need to revise or repeal an existing law. They also can be motivated by personal experiences. The late Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), in an action that contradicted his fierce opposition to government regulation, sponsored a bill requiring warnings about the dangers of alcohol in all advertising after his daughter was killed by a drunk driver.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_043">Roger H. Davidson and Walter J. Oleszek, <em class="emphasis">Congress and Its Members</em>, 8th ed. (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 2002).</span> National emergencies can prompt members to take action. Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America. This act created the Department of Homeland Security, a new government agency for emergency preparedness.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_s01_p02">Legislation can originate as a result of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">executive communication</a><span class="glossdef">A message from the president, a Cabinet member, or an agency head to the Speaker of the House or president of the Senate recommending that Congress address a policy or budgetary issue.</span></span>, a message or letter from the president, a cabinet member, or an agency head to the Speaker of the House or president of the Senate recommending that Congress address a policy or budgetary issue. These requests often follow the president’s State of the Union address. Presidents also can make their agendas known to Congress by making speeches that are publicized through the media. Executive communications are referred to appropriate congressional committees, which decide whether or not to act on them. The president uses an executive communication to submit his proposed budget to the House Committee on Appropriations, which uses it as a basis for drafting federal funding legislation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_044">Charles W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_s02_p01">If it is to have much chance of becoming law, a bill must be drafted into a proposal that will generate support in Congress as well as among the public, interest groups, and the executive branch. Bills are drafted by members with the assistance of their staffs and experts in the House and Senate legislative counsel offices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_s02_p02">A bill’s language can be instrumental in generating media publicity and subsequently support for or opposition to it. The title can position the bill in the public debate, as it captures the ideas and images proponents wish to convey. Megan’s Law, which requires communities to publicize the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders, is named after Megan Kanka, a New Jersey girl who was murdered by a sex offender after his release from prison. Politically charged shorthand often is used to characterize bills. The health-care reform legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 has been labeled “Obamacare” by opponents seeking to repeal the legislation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Budget Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p01">One of the most arduous tasks faced by Congress is passing legislation authorizing the nation’s annual budget. House and Senate members, their staffs, and congressional committees in conjunction with the president and the executive branch are responsible for preparing the budget. The president submits a detailed budget proposal to Congress, which serves as a starting point. The House and Senate Budget Committees hold hearings on the budget to get advice about how funds should be spent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p02">The nonpartisan <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Congressional Budget Office</a><span class="glossdef">Provides expert budgetary advice to Congress.</span></span> (CBO) with a staff of over 230 economists and policy analysts, provides expert budgetary advice to Congress. It reviews the president’s budget plan, projects the actual costs of budget items, and develops options for changes in taxing and spending. CBO staffers prepare detailed reports on the budget and testify before Congress.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_055">“CBO’s Role in the Budget Office” (Washington, DC: Congressional Budget Office, 2005), accessed February 16, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/visitorsgallery/budgetprocess.shtml">http://www.cbo.gov/visitorsgallery/budgetprocess.shtml</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p03">A two-step authorization and appropriations process is required to establish and fund specific programs within the guidelines set by the annual budget. Congress must first pass laws authorizing or recommending that federal programs receive funding at a particular level. The appropriations process, where funds are actually allocated to programs for spending, is the second step. The House Appropriations Committee initiates all bills to fund programs, and its counterpart in the Senate must approve funding bills. The budget resolution that ultimately passes the House and Senate Budget Committees is usually markedly different from the president’s budget proposal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p04">The budget process rarely goes smoothly. The process can stall, as was the case in 2011 when the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget threatened to result in a government shutdown. Media coverage highlighting partisan bickering over what to fund and what to cut from the budget added to the drama surrounding the budget process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">C-SPAN</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s03_p01">Members of the public can follow congressional action live on television. After much debate, televised coverage of floor proceedings via the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) was established in the House in 1979 and in the Senate in 1986. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">C-SPAN</a><span class="glossdef">The cable network that provides gavel-to-gavel coverage of congressional floor proceedings, committee hearings, and special events.</span></span> transmits gavel-to-gavel coverage of floor action.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s03_p02">C-SPAN affirmed Congress as a media-conscious institution.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_056">Timothy E. Cook, <em class="emphasis">Making Laws &amp; Making News</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1989).</span> A top Rules Committee staffer explained that Congress had tired of losing the battle with the president for media attention: “President Richard Nixon was dominating the airwaves with defenses of his Vietnam War policies, while Congressional opponents were not being given equal access by the networks.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_057">Walter J. Oleszek, “The Internet and Congressional Decisionmaking,” report prepared for the Chairman of the House Rules Committee, September 19, 2001.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s03_p03">C-SPAN’s cameras show Congress at its best and worst, at its most dramatic and most mundane. They showcase members’ elegant floor speeches and capture them joking and looking bored during hearings. C-SPAN is monitored continuously in most congressional offices and is a source of information and images for other mass media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s03_p04">C-SPAN has expanded its operation beyond cable television and provides extensive radio and online coverage of Congress, the White House, and national politics.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s03_p08">Making laws is a complex process guided by volumes of rules and influenced by politics. While many bills are proposed each congressional session, few make it all the way through the process to be signed by the president and made law. Congress is responsible for passing legislation enacting the nation’s annual budget, which is frequently a difficult task. The activities of Congress are reported by C-SPAN, which began as a cable network providing gavel-to-gavel coverage of floor proceedings and has expanded to become an extensive resource for information about government and politics.</p>
