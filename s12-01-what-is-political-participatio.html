    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Americans have many options for taking part in politics, including voting, contacting public officials, campaigning, running for and holding office, protesting, and volunteering.

Voter registration and turnout is influenced by legal and structural factors, voter qualifications, the type of election, and voters’ enthusiasm about a particular campaign.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">Far more people participate in politics by voting than by any other means. Yet there are many other ways to take part in politics that involve varying amounts of skill, time, and resources. People can work in an election campaign, contact public officials, circulate a petition, join a political organization, and donate money to a candidate or a cause. Serving on a local governing or school board, volunteering in the community, and running for office are forms of participation that require significant time and energy. Organizing a demonstration, protesting, and even rioting are other forms of participation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_007">Lester W. Milbrath and M. L. Goel, <em class="emphasis">Political Participation</em>, 2nd ed. (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1977).</span></p>

These events are designed to raise money and awareness of societal problems, such as poverty and health care. However, most participants are not activists for these causes. Support activities can lead to active participation, as people learn about issues through these events and decide to become involved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p04">People also can engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">symbolic participation</a><span class="glossdef">Routine or habitual acts that show support for or dissatisfaction with the political system.</span></span>, routine or habitual acts that show support for the political system.

Citizens can show their unhappiness with leadership choices by the symbolic act of not voting.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Voting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p01">For many people, voting is the primary means of taking part in politics. A unique and special political act, voting allows for the views of more people to be represented than any other activity. Every citizen gets one vote that counts equally. Over 90 percent of Americans agree with the principle that citizens have a duty to vote.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_008">William H. Flanigan and Nancy H. Zingale, <em class="emphasis">Political Behavior of the American Electorate</em>, 9th ed. (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 1999).</span> Still, many people do not vote regularly.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Voter Qualifications</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p01">Registered voters meet eligibility requirements and have filed the necessary paperwork that permits them to vote in a given locality. In addition to the requirement that voters must be eighteen years of age, states can enforce residency requirements that mandate the number of years a person must live in a place before being eligible to vote. A large majority of people who have registered to vote participate in presidential elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p02">The composition of the electorate has changed radically throughout American history. The pool of eligible voters has expanded from primarily white, male property owners at the founding to include black men after the Civil War, women after 1920, and eighteen- to twenty-year-olds after 1971. The eligible electorate in the 1800s, when voter turnout consistently exceeded 70 percent, was far different than the diverse pool of eligible voters today.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Barriers to Voting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p01">Social, cultural, and economic factors can keep people from voting. Some barriers to voting are informal. The United States holds a large number of elections, and each is governed by specific rules and schedules. With so many elections, people can become overwhelmed, confused, or just plain tired of voting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p02">Other barriers are structural. Voter registration laws were implemented in the 1860s by states and big cities to ensure that only citizens who met legal requirements could vote. Residency requirements limited access to registration offices. Closing voting rosters weeks or months in advance of elections effectively disenfranchised voters. Over time, residency requirements were relaxed. Beginning in the 1980s, some states, including Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, made it possible for people to register on Election Day. Turnout in states that have Election Day registration averages ten points higher than in the rest of the country.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_009">Raymond E. Wolfinger and Steven J. Rosenstone, <em class="emphasis">Who Votes?</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1980).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p03">The United States is one of the few democracies that requires citizens to register themselves rather than having the government take responsibility for automatically registering them. Significant steps have been taken to make registration easier. In 1993, Congress passed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">National Voter Registration Act</a><span class="glossdef">A law that allows citizens to register to vote at motor vehicle and social services offices; also known as the “motor voter” law.</span></span>, also known as the “motor voter” law, allowing citizens to register at motor vehicle and social service offices. “Motor voter’s” success in increasing the ranks of registered voters differs by state depending on how well the program is publicized and executed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p04">Voter registration also has been assisted by online registration. In most cases, individuals must download the form, sign it, and mail it in. Rock the Vote (RTV), a nonpartisan youth mobilization organization, established the first online voter registration initiative in 1992 with official backing from the Congressional Internet Caucus. RTV registered over 2 million new voters in 1992, 80 percent of whom cast a ballot, and signed up over 2.5 million voters in 2008.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_010">“The Campaign: Rockers and Rappers,” <em class="emphasis">The Economist</em>, June 20, 1993, 25.</span> Following the 2008 election, RTV lobbied the Obama administration to institute fully automated online voter registration nationally.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Disenfranchisement of Felons</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03_p01">In all states except Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, inmates serving time for committing felonies lose their right to vote. At least ten states prohibit former felons from voting even after they have served their time. States argue that their legal authority to deny convicted felons voting rights derives from the Fourteenth Amendment, which stipulates that voting rights of individuals guilty of “participation in rebellion, or other crime” can be denied. This practice excludes almost 4 million people from the voting rolls.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_011">Human Rights Watch and the Sentencing Project, <em class="emphasis">Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws</em> (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2000).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03_p02">Opinions are divided on this issue. Some people believe that individuals who have committed a serious crime should be deprived of the privileges enjoyed by law-abiding people. Others contend that the integrity of the democratic process is at stake and that individuals should not be denied a fundamental right once they have served their time.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Turnout</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p01">Voter turnout depends on the type of election. A large number of elections are held in the United States every year, including local elections, elections for county and statewide offices, primaries, and general elections. Only a small number of people, generally under one-quarter of those eligible, participate in local, county, and state elections. Midterm elections, in which members of Congress run for office in nonpresidential-election years, normally draw about one-third of eligible voters.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_012">Steven J. Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen, <em class="emphasis">Mobilization, Participation, and Democracy in America</em> (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1993), 1.</span> Voter turnout in presidential elections is generally higher than for lower-level contests; usually more than half the eligible voters cast a ballot.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p02">Much is made about low levels of voter turnout for presidential elections in the current era. However, there have not been great fluctuations in turnout since the institution of universal suffrage in 1920. Forty-nine percent of the voting-age public cast a ballot in the 1924 presidential contest, the same percentage as in 1996. Turnout in presidential elections in the 1960s was over 60 percent. More voters were mobilized during this period of political upheaval in which people focused on issues of race relations, social welfare, and the Vietnam War.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_013">Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward, <em class="emphasis">Why Americans Still Don’t Vote</em> (Boston: Beacon Press, 2000).</span> Turnout was lower in the 1980s and 1990s, when the political climate was less tumultuous. There has been a steady increase in turnout since the 2000 presidential election, in which 51 percent of the voting-age public cast a ballot. Turnout was 55 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2008, when 132,618,580 people went to the polls.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_014">Michael McDonald, “Voter Turnout,” <em class="emphasis">United States Election Project</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm">http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p03">Turnout varies significantly across localities. Some regions have an established culture of political participation. Local elections in small towns in New England draw up to 80 percent of qualified voters. Over 70 percent of Minnesota voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election compared with 51 percent in Hawaii and West Virginia.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_015">Michael McDonald, “Voter Turnout,” <em class="emphasis">United States Election Project</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm">http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p04">Turnout figures can be skewed by undercounting the vote. This problem gained attention during the 2000 election. The contested vote in the Florida presidential race resulted in a recount in several counties. Ballots can be invalidated if they are not properly marked by voters or are not read by antiquated voting machines. Political scientists have determined that presidential election turnout is underestimated on average by 4 percent, which translates into hundreds of thousands of votes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_016">William H. Flanigan and Nancy H. Zingale, <em class="emphasis">Political Behavior of the American Electorate</em>, 9th ed. (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 1999).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p05">Voters in midterm elections choose all the members of the US House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate, along with office holders at the state and local levels. Voter turnout levels have hovered around 40 percent in the past three midterm elections. Turnout for the 2010 midterm election was 41.6 percent, compared with 41.4 percent in 2006 and 40.5 percent in 2002.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_017">Michael McDonald, “Voter Turnout,” <em class="emphasis">United States Election Project</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm">http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm</a>.</span> Young voters are less likely to turn out in midterm elections than older citizens.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p01">People have many options for engaging in politics.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p01">Expressing opinions about leaders, issues, and policies has become one of the most prominent forms of political participation. The number of people contacting public officials at all levels of government has risen markedly over the past three decades. Seventeen percent of Americans contacted a public official in 1976. By 2008, 44 percent of the public had contacted their member of Congress about an issue or concern.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_019">Congressional Management Foundation, <em class="emphasis">Communicating with Congress: How the Internet Has Changed Citizen Engagement</em> (Washington, DC: Congressional Management Foundation, 2008).</span> E-mail has made contacting public officials cheaper and easier than the traditional method of mailing a letter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p02">Students interning for public officials soon learn that answering constituent mail is one of the most time-consuming staff jobs. Every day, millions of people voice their opinions to members of Congress. The Senate alone receives an average of over four million e-mail messages per week and more than two hundred million e-mail messages per year.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn08_020">Congressional Management Foundation, <em class="emphasis">Communicating With Congress: How the Internet Has Changed Citizen Engagement</em> (Washington, DC: Congressional Management Foundation, 2008).</span> Still, e-mail may not be the most effective way of getting a message across because office holders believe that an e-mail message takes less time, effort, and thought than a traditional letter. Leaders frequently are “spammed” with mass e-mails that are not from their constituents. Letters and phone calls almost always receive some kind of a response from members of Congress.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s04_p02">Potential candidates for public office must gather signatures on a petition before their names can appear on the ballot. Some people may be discouraged from running because the signature requirement seems daunting. For example, running for mayor of New York City requires 7,500 signatures and addresses on a petition. Once a candidate gets on the ballot, she must organize a campaign, solicit volunteers, raise funds, and garner press coverage.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p02">Extreme discontent with a particular societal condition can lead to rioting. Riots are frequently spontaneous and are sparked by an incident that brings to a head deep-seated frustrations and emotions. Members of social movements may resort to rioting when they perceive that there are no conventional alternatives for getting their message across. Riots can result in destruction of property, looting, physical harm, and even death. Racial tensions sparked by a video of police beating Rodney King in 1991 and the subsequent acquittal of the officers at trial resulted in the worst riots ever experienced in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p03">In March 1991, KTLA News at Ten in Los Angeles interrupted programming to broadcast an eighty-one-second amateur videotape of several police officers savagely beating black motorist Rodney King as he stood next to his vehicle. A nineteen-second edit of the tape depicted the most brutal police actions and became one of the most heavily broadcast images in television news history. The original and the edited tape tell two different stories of the same event.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p04">Viewing the entire tape, one would have seen a belligerent and violent Rodney King who was difficult for police to constrain. Not filmed at all was an intoxicated King driving erratically, leading police on an eight-mile, high-speed chase through crowded streets.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p05">The edited video showing the beating of King told a different story of police brutality and was the basis of much controversy. Race relations in Los Angeles in 1991 were strained. The tape enraged blacks in Los Angeles who saw the police actions as being widespread within the Los Angeles Police Department and not an isolated incident.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s05_p06">Four white officers were tried in criminal court for the use of excessive force, and they were acquitted of all but one charge. Jurors were shown the entire tape, not just the famous nineteen-second clip. Soon after the verdict was announced, riots broke out. Demonstrators burned buildings and assaulted bystanders. Fifty-four people were killed and two thousand were wounded. Property damage was in the millions of dollars.</p>

Today, students demonstrate to draw attention to causes. They make use of new communications technologies to organize protests by forming groups on the Internet. Online strategies have been used to organize demonstrations against the globalization policies of the World Trade Organization and the World Bank. Over two hundred websites were established to rally support for protests in Seattle, Washington; Washington, DC; Quebec City, Canada; and other locations. Protest participants received online instructions at the protest site about travel and housing, where to assemble, and how to behave if arrested. Extensive e-mail listservs keep protestors and sympathizers in contact between demonstrations. Twitter, a social messaging platform that allows people to provide short updates in real time, has been used to convey eyewitness reports of protests worldwide. Americans followed the riots surrounding the contested presidential election in Iran in 2009 on Twitter, as observers posted unfiltered, graphic details as the violent event unfolded.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s07_p03">There are many different ways that Americans can participate in politics, including voting, joining political parties, volunteering, contacting public officials, contributing money, working in campaigns, holding public office, protesting, and rioting. Voting is the most prevalent form of political participation, although many eligible voters do not turn out in elections. People can take part in social movements in which large groups of individuals with shared goals work together to influence government policies. New media provide novel opportunities for political participation, such as using Facebook to campaign for a candidate and Twitter to keep people abreast of a protest movement.</p>
