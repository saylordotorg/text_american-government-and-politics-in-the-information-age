    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_p02">Information about or relevant to politics, government, and public policies commonly appears in the mass media in the form of news. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">News</a><span class="glossdef">Reports by journalists of selected events commonly involving violence, conflict, disasters, and scandals.</span></span> is a selective account of what happens in the world. Common subjects are violence (wars), crime (school shootings), natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes), and scandals (sexual, financial). The statements and actions of powerful or prominent people are news. So are human interest stories, such as the rescue of Private Jessica Lynch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_p03">News is timely, a breaking event, like an assassination attempt on a president. Or newly revealed information, such as a presidential candidate’s drunk-driving conviction, even if it happened years ago. Slow-moving processes that may be of vital importance (e.g., the spread of AIDS or global warming) take time to become news, often requiring a “peg”—the release of an alarmist study, a congressional hearing, or presidential speech—on which to hang the story.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Journalists</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">News is reported by journalists. They work under time pressure with tight deadlines to come up with stories around the clock. This job has become more difficult in recent years as budget cuts have led news organizations to demand more stories for more outlets from fewer reporters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">A majority of journalists are white, middle class, middle-aged, and male. Women now compose about one-third of the press corps and racial minorities around one-tenth. In a survey, 36 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 33 percent as Independents, and 18 percent as Republicans.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_020">For journalists’ backgrounds, see David H. Weaver, Randal A. Beam, Bonnie J. Brownlee, Paul S. Voakes, and G. Cleveland Wilhoit, <em class="emphasis">The American Journalist in the 21st Century</em> (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007), 20.</span> Reporters tend to be pro-choice, for gay rights, and in favor of protecting the environment. But they try to refrain from showing their preferences in their stories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">Any influence of reporters’ characteristics and opinions on their stories is limited by the norms of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">objectivity</a><span class="glossdef">In news reporting, impartiality and fairness, and the reporting of facts without opinion and including different sides of an issue.</span></span> they learn in journalism school or on the job. Specified in the profession’s code of ethics, these include reporting accurate information, not deliberately distorting or plagiarizing, and separating reporting from advocacy.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_021">Society of Professional Journalists, Code of Ethics, adopted September 1996.</span> Journalists are expected to report different sides of an issue, be impartial and fair, and exclude their personal opinions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_022">David T. Z. Mindich, <em class="emphasis">Just the Facts: How “Objectivity” Came to Define American Journalism</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1998).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p04">If they are found out, journalists who deliberately and blatantly violate the profession’s ethics are punished. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reporter Jayson Blair was dismissed after it was discovered that he had fabricated or plagiarized around forty of the six hundred articles he had written for the paper; editors resigned in the wake of the discoveries. Jack Kelly was the star foreign correspondent for <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> and had worked for the paper for over twenty years when he resigned in January 2004, accused of plagiarism and of inventing parts or all of some of his stories.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Depictions of Journalists</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p05">Many of our impressions of journalists, their behavior, importance, and trustworthiness come from the media.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_023">For a study of movie depictions of American journalism, see Matthew C. Ehrlich, <em class="emphasis">Journalism in the Movies</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2004).</span> Media depictions repeat two types best captured in the classic film <em class="emphasis">His Girl Friday</em>: reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) and her editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant).</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p06">The first type exemplified by Hildy is the journalist as intrepid seeker after truth and crusader for justice. The most famous real-life equivalents are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reporters who helped uncover the Watergate scandal and wrote a book about it, <em class="emphasis">All the President’s Men</em>, which was turned into a popular Hollywood movie. Even some caustic satires of the news business contain versions of the journalist as noble loner. In <em class="emphasis">Network</em>, Peter Finch plays a television news anchor who begins to go insane on camera, shouting “I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore.” In the movie, his pain and anguish are exploited by amoral network executives. In real life, his battle cry became the theme of citizens’ tax revolts in the late seventies and could be heard at Tea Party rallies thirty years later.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p07">The second type of journalist, characterized by Walter Burns, is more common in the entertainment media. At their worst, as in Billy Wilder’s classic <em class="emphasis">Ace in the Hole</em>, such reporters cynically and callously exploit the disasters of the human condition. But even less bitter films show reporters as inevitably led astray from their devotion to the truth to the point that they destroy lives and reputations in their reckless search for an exclusive story ahead of other reporters (a <strong class="emphasis bold">scoop</strong>) that is dramatic and shocking. In <em class="emphasis">Absence of Malice</em>, Sally Field plays a reporter who ends up besmirching a good man’s (Paul Newman) reputation. In <em class="emphasis">Broadcast News</em>, William Hurt and Albert Brooks compete to become a news anchor. Hurt—good-looking, smooth, unscrupulous, and none too bright—wins out over the dumpier, knowledgeable, and dedicated Brooks.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p08">A contemporary example of the second type is Rita Skeeter. Introduced by J. K. Rowling in her vastly popular Harry Potter series, Skeeter writes for the <em class="emphasis">Daily Prophet</em>, <em class="emphasis">Witch Weekly</em>, and other publications. She is untrustworthy, unscrupulous, vindictive, and vile. She justifies her behavior with the motto “Our readers have a right to the truth.” But her news stories are error-strewn and full of lies. They destroy friendships, inflict pain and suffering, and deprive decent people of their jobs. Rita Skeeter gets scoops by turning herself into a bug. The moral is that such journalists are nasty bugs.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_024">J. K. Rowling, <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> (New York: Scholastic Press, 2000), especially 433–53, 511–15, 611–15, and 726–28; the quotation is on p. 450.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Acquiring the News</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">Journalists follow standard procedures to obtain the news. They go to the scene, especially of wars and disasters. They talk to people who have participated in, witnessed, or claim to know what happened. They dig into records. Easing their job, many events, such as press conferences, trials, and elections, are scheduled ahead of time.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Beats</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p01">News organizations guarantee stories by assigning reporters to cover distinct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beats</a><span class="glossdef">Institutions, organizations, and subjects that a reporter is assigned to cover regularly.</span></span> such as the White House or specific subjects such as environmental policy. Institutions and subjects not on reporters’ beats (off the beaten track, so to speak) generate few stories unless they do something to become newsworthy. Sometimes events thrust them into prominence, as when the banking crisis of 2008 raised questions about the regulatory effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p01">Journalists interact with and rely extensively on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sources</a><span class="glossdef">People, often in government, who, for one reason or another, provide reporters with information.</span></span>—generally people in government and politics, especially those in high positions of authority—to provide them with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scoops</a><span class="glossdef">News obtained ahead of other reporters.</span></span> and quotations. Other sources are whistle-blowers, who reveal information they have about dubious activities, outrages, or scandals. Depending on their motives, sources either provide information openly and unreservedly or leak it subject to various conditions such as anonymity.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_025">Stephen Hess, <em class="emphasis">The Government/Press Connection: Press Officers and Their Offices</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 1984), chap. 7.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p02">Often the reporter-source relationship is symbiotic: they need each other. Reporters need sources for news. Sources need reporters to get their views and information into the news, to obtain favorable coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p03">Sometimes the relationship is adversarial, with reporters pressing a reluctant source for information. Sources must often respond to reporters’ ideas of what is news. Information from one beat may inspire a news story that another beat wants to keep quiet. Refusal to reveal information may result in negative coverage and in sources becoming targets in reporters’ and columnists’ stories.</p>

Typical is a <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>’s front page story headlined “Terror Suspects Buying Firearms, Report Finds” (in the United States), based on an investigation by the Government Accountability Office.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_026">Eric Lichtblau, “Terror Suspects Buying Firearms, Report Finds,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 8, 2005, A1.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">News Services</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s05_p01">The mass media rely on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wire services</a><span class="glossdef">Agencies, particularly the Associated Press (AP), that cover and transmit news stories from throughout the world to their subscribers, resulting in similar coverage in many of the news media.</span></span> for much of their international and national news. Wire services cover and transmit stories worldwide from their own staff and from reporters who work for the many newspapers and other organizations that belong to the services. Prominent wire services are the Associated Press (AP) and Reuters. The AP sends news to approximately 1,700 newspapers, 5,000 radio and television stations, and 8,500 other media outlets in over 100 countries.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_s05_p02">Video feeds supplied by the AP and Reuters are the source of much of the televised international news. Subscribers are sent video accompanied by natural sound without narration and brief printed informational scripts. Four of CBS’s eight foreign correspondents are based in London doing voice-overs for these feeds for broadcast on the network’s news programs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prominence and Presentation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p01">As a result of widely agreed-upon criteria of newsworthiness, the process of gathering the news, and the use of news services, the news media often report many of the same stories. Only a few stories are featured prominently due to limitations in broadcast prime time and front-page print space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Nonetheless, there are some differences among the media in the range and type of news on which they focus. For example, the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, with its stable of reporters in Washington, DC, and foreign correspondents, emphasizes government and politics in the United States and abroad. Cable news channels focus more on crimes and celebrities. Aside from a few stories, such as the war in Iraq and natural disasters, they give short shrift to foreign stories. In fact, the Fox News Channel has a segment titled “Around the World in 80 Seconds.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p03">The media also differ stylistically in how they present the news. The <em class="emphasis">Times</em> does it with relative sobriety. Cable channels dramatize their reports by announcing “breaking news,” using graphic captions, accompanying stories with pulsating music, engaging in fast-paced editing, and repeatedly admonishing viewers to “stay with us.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p04">Television news is picture driven: stories with appealing, dramatic, or even available camera footage are more likely to be played prominently than those without. Viewers are unaware of what is not shown, what happened before or after the picture was taken, and whether or not the shot was staged. Camera angles, distance from the subject, especially close-ups, length of shot, camera movement, and editing all influence viewers’ impressions. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but it can also mislead, as <a class="xref" href="#paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_n01">Note 1.17 "Enduring Image"</a> reveals.</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Enduring Image</h3>
            <p class="simpara">The Overthrow of Saddam Hussein</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p05">The toppling of a dictator’s statue is an enduring image, symbolizing the literal collapse of a regime’s authority and the massive uprising and joy of a population freed at last from tyranny. On April 9, 2003, a US mechanized vehicle using a cable pulled down Saddam Hussein’s mammoth statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square. The square was sealed off by US marines. The few people in it were US soldiers, Iraqis from the United States, promoted “Free Iraqi Forces Militia” (comprising exiles who had recently been returned to the country by the Pentagon), and journalists.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p06">On television the statue falls, the crowd cheers. On the front pages of newspapers in the United States and around the world, the Reuters news-agency photograph shows the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue under the watchful eye of an American soldier. The images symbolize the US defeat of the dictator and his regime and the Iraqi people celebrating their newfound freedom. Wider shots of the square, revealing that only a handful of people were in the plaza, were far less common.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_028">The differences between the photographs was brought to our attention in the May/June 2003 issue of <em class="emphasis">Extra!</em>, p. 8.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p07">The first photograph of the statue being pulled down reflects news values of vividness, drama, and conflict. It spectacularly hearkens back to the removal of statues of Lenin and Stalin after the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. The alternative photos, showing much more of the relatively empty square, lacked dramatic news values and thus their symbolic effects.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p08">Because the news media found the dramatic image to be irresistible, they reinforced a frame, pushed by the Bush administration, of a jubilant Iraqi population welcoming its liberators. But the meaning of an image can change. Now, for many people, the falling statue represents the illusion of a US military success that turned into a quagmire of frustration.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p01">As we document throughout our book, people involved in public life understand that their election and reelection, their effectiveness in elected and appointed office, and their ability to achieve their policies often depend on how they and their deliberations and debates, disagreements and conflicts, cooperation and consensus, actions and inactions, and struggles for power, are portrayed by the media. They know that media depictions can influence people’s opinions, understandings of policy problems and notions of solutions, and can encourage or discourage participation in politics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p02">They know that information is power. The more of it they have before others the better. They have aides who gather, synthesize, and summarize the news from newspapers and television, from talk shows, political publications (<em class="emphasis">Roll Call</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Hill</em>), polls, websites, and blogs.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_029">Ashley Parker, “Where News Is Power, a Fight to Be Well-Armed,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 18, 2011, A14, 17.</span> So they and their staff interact with media personnel to try to manage and manipulate the news and influence journalists’ selection of stories and how they are framed. They present (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spin</a><span class="glossdef">To interpret information to support one’s point of view, or at least to put the best face on events.</span></span>) their behavior, activities, and actions, and policies and decisions, as positively as possible; they conceal, minimize, or put the best gloss on their mistakes and blunders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p03">They engage in public appearances, make speeches, hold press conferences, and stage newsworthy events. They also deploy an arsenal of savvy techniques such as brief, pithy phrases known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sound bites</a><span class="glossdef">Brief phrases uttered by candidates that are designed to be compelling and fit into news stories.</span></span>. Behind the scenes they bestow favors, such as giving access to sympathetic journalists; persuade; apply pressure; and engage in intimidation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_030">Timothy E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p04">Despite these attempts at manipulation, the news media’s coverage of people in public life is not necessarily favorable. Three common types of coverage are lap-dog, watch-dog, and attack-dog journalism.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_s01_p02">A notable example of the news media as lap dogs was their coverage of the Bush administration’s claims in 2002–2003 that Iraq must be attacked because it possessed weapons of mass destruction. Leaders of the Democratic Party did not forcefully challenge the White House’s official story, plans, and rationale. Most of the news media then transmitted the administration’s arguments without subjecting them to sustained analysis and criticism.</p>

This type of coverage can be provoked by dramatic events, such as Hurricane Katrina, to which the Bush administration responded unconvincingly. Journalists went to the scene, saw the devastation and havoc for themselves, and showed it directly to viewers. Outraged reporters asked so many impassioned questions of administration officials about their inadequate response to Katrina that the Salon website compiled a “Reporters Gone Wild” video clip.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_032">See W.

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_s03_p02">In this section, we have explained how journalists decide what is news, how they acquire news (through beats, sources, investigative reporting, and other ways), and how they present news. We have described the techniques that people in public life use to manage and manipulate the news media to obtain positive and avoid negative depictions. And we have specified three ways that the news media can behave toward people in government and politics: as lap dogs, watchdogs, or attack dogs.</p>
