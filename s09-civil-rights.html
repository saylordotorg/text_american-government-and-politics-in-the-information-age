        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s00_p01">The campaign for the Democratic party’s nomination for president in 2008 culminated in a contest between a mixed-race man and a white woman. Both candidates addressed their identities directly and with pride. Barack Obama gave a notable speech about race, saying that black anger and white resentments were grounded in legitimate concerns and that Americans must work together to move beyond their racial wounds. Conceding defeat in June, Hillary Clinton told her supporters, “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, it’s got about eighteen million cracks in it.”</p>

At the same time, the media reported that the Democratic contest and Obama’s nomination symbolized how far civil rights have come in America from the dark days of segregation. This frame became dominant when Obama was elected president in November 2008.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Civil War Amendments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Equality did not enter the Constitution until the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Civil War Amendments</a><span class="glossdef">The three amendments added to the Constitution (Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth) after the Civil War to establish the legal status and rights of the newly freed slaves.</span></span> (the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth) set forth the status and rights of former slaves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">In early 1865, with the Union’s triumph in the Civil War assured, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment. Quickly ratified by victorious Union states, it outlawed slavery and “involuntary servitude.” It authorized Congress to pass laws enforcing the amendment—giving it the power to eradicate not simply slavery but all “badges of servitude.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_002">Herman Belz, <em class="emphasis">A New Birth of Freedom: The Republican Party and Freedmen’s Rights, 1861–1866</em>, 2nd ed. (New York: Fordham University Press, 2000), chap. 7.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p03">Abraham Lincoln, assassinated in 1865, was succeeded as president by Andrew Johnson, who pushed for a quick reunion of North and South. Republicans in Congress feared that the rights of newly freed slaves would be denied by a return to the old order. Distrusting Johnson, they decided protections had to be put into the Constitution. Congress enacted the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and made its ratification a condition for the Southern states’ reentry into the Union.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p04">The Fourteenth Amendment contains three key clauses. First, anyone born in the United States is a US citizen, and anyone residing in a state is a citizen of that state. So it affirmed African Americans as US and state citizens.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p05">Second, the amendment bars states from depriving anyone, whether a citizen or not, of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” It thereby extended the Bill of Rights’ due process requirement on the federal government to the states.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p06">Third, the amendment holds that a state may not “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equal protection clause</a><span class="glossdef">The section of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution that requires states to ensure “equal protection of the laws” to all individuals.</span></span> is the Supreme Court’s major instrument for scrutinizing state regulations. It is at the heart of all civil rights. Though the clause was designed to restrict states, the Supreme Court has ruled that it applies to the federal government, too.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_003"><em class="emphasis">Bolling v. Sharpe</em>, 347 US 497 (1954). See also <em class="emphasis">Adarand Constructors v. Peña</em>, 515 US 200 (1995).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p07">The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, bars federal and state governments from infringing on a citizen’s right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p08">The Bill of Rights <em class="emphasis">limited</em> the powers of the federal government; the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html">Civil War Amendments</a> <em class="emphasis">expanded</em> them. These amendments created new powers for Congress and the states to support equality. They recognized for the first time a right to vote.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p09">Political debate and conflict surround how, where, and when civil rights protections are applied. The complex US political system provides opportunities for disadvantaged groups to claim and obtain their civil rights. At the same time, the many divisions built into the Constitution by the separation of powers and federalism can be used to frustrate the achievement of civil rights.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">The federal government retreated from the Civil War Amendments that protected the civil rights of African Americans. Most African Americans resided in the South, where almost all were disenfranchised and segregated by the end of the nineteenth century by Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation of public schools, accommodation, transportation, and other public places.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p04">Enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment’s right to vote proved difficult and costly. Blacks voted in large numbers but faced violence from whites. Vigilante executions of blacks by mobs for alleged or imagined crimes reached new highs. In 1892 alone, 161 lynchings were documented, and many more surely occurred.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p05">In 1894, Democrats took charge of the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since the Civil War. They repealed all federal oversight of elections and delegated enforcement to the states.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_004">William Gillette, <em class="emphasis">Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869–1879</em> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1979), chap. 2. Data on lynching are in Robert L. Zangrando, <em class="emphasis">The NAACP’s Crusade Against Lynching, 1909–1950</em> (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1980), table 2.</span> Southern states quickly restricted African American voting. They required potential voters to take a literacy test or to interpret a section of the Constitution. Whites who failed an often easier test might still qualify to vote by virtue of a “grandfather clause,” which allowed those whose grandfathers had voted before the Civil War to register.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p06">The Supreme Court also reduced the scope of the Civil War Amendments by nullifying federal laws banning discrimination. The Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not empower the federal government to act against private persons.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p07"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">De jure segregation</a><span class="glossdef">Separation of the races by law and public policies.</span></span>—the separation of races by the law—received the Supreme Court’s blessing in the 1896 case of <em class="emphasis">Plessy v. Ferguson</em>. A Louisiana law barred whites and blacks from sitting together on trains. A Louisiana equal rights group, seeking to challenge the law, recruited a light-skinned African American, Homer Plessy, to board a train car reserved for whites. Plessy was arrested. His lawyers claimed the law denied him equal protection. By a vote of 8–1, the justices ruled against Plessy, stating that these accommodations were acceptable because they were “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">separate but equal</a><span class="glossdef">The doctrine, endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em class="emphasis">Plessy v. Ferguson</em> (1896) and repudiated by <em class="emphasis">Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954), that racial segregation was constitutional as long as all races were treated equally.</span></span>.” Racial segregation did not violate equal protection, provided both races were treated equally.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_005"><em class="emphasis">Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, 163 US 537 (1896)</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p08"><em class="emphasis">Plessy v. Ferguson</em> gave states the green light to segregate on the basis of race. “Separate but equal” was far from equal in practice. Whites rarely sought access to areas reserved for blacks, which were of inferior quality. Such segregation extended to all areas of social life, including entertainment media. Films with all-black or all-white casts were shot for separate movie houses for blacks and whites.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Mobilizing against Segregation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">At the dawn of the twentieth century, African Americans, segregated by race and disenfranchised by law and violence, debated how to improve their lot. One approach accepted segregation and pursued self-help, vocational education, and individual economic advancement. Its spokesman, Booker T. Washington, head of Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute, wrote the best-selling memoir <em class="emphasis">Up from Slavery</em> (1901) and worked to build institutions for African Americans, such as colleges for blacks only. Sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois replied to Washington with his book <em class="emphasis">The Soul of Black Folk</em> (1903), which argued that blacks should protest and agitate for the vote and for civil rights.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">Du Bois’s writings gained the attention of white and black Northern reformers who founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. Du Bois served as director of publicity and research, investigating inequities, generating news, and going on speaking tours.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_006">Charles Flint Kellogg, <em class="emphasis">NAACP: A History of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</em>, vol. 1 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p03">The NAACP brought test cases to court that challenged segregationist practices. Its greatest successes came starting in the 1930s, in a legal strategy led by Thurgood Marshall, who would later be appointed to the Supreme Court. Marshall urged the courts to nullify programs that provided substandard facilities for blacks on the grounds that they were a violation of “separate but equal.” In a key 1937 victory, the Supreme Court ruled that, by providing a state law school for whites without doing the same for blacks, Missouri was denying equal protection.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_007"><em class="emphasis">Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada</em>, 305 US 676 (1937). See Mark V. Tushnet, <em class="emphasis">The NAACP’s Legal Strategy Against Segregated Education, 1925–1950</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987), chaps. 2–5.</span> Such triumphs did not threaten segregation but made Southern states take “separate but equal” more seriously, sometimes forcing them to give funds for black colleges, which became centers for political action.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_008">Doug McAdam, <em class="emphasis">Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930–1970</em>, 2nd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p04">During World War I, Northern factories recruited rural Southern black men for work, starting a “Great Migration” northward that peaked in the 1960s. In Northern cities, African Americans voted freely, had fewer restrictions on their civil rights, organized themselves effectively, and participated in politics. They began to elect black members of Congress, and built prosperous black newspapers. When the United States entered World War II, many African Americans were brought into the defense industries and the armed forces. Black soldiers who returned from fighting for their country engaged in more militant politics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p05">President Harry S. Truman saw black citizens as a sizable voting bloc. In 1946, he named an advisory commission to recommend civil rights policies. Amid his 1948 election campaign, Truman issued executive orders that adopted two of its suggestions: desegregating the armed forces and creating review boards in each cabinet department to monitor discrimination. With the crucial help of Northern black votes, Truman won in an upset.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s03_p01">In the 1940s, Supreme Court decisions on lawsuits brought by the NAACP and argued by Thurgood Marshall chipped away at “separate but equal.” In 1941, Arthur Mitchell, a black member of Congress from Chicago, was kicked out of a first-class sleeping car when his train entered Arkansas. The Court ruled that the Arkansas law enforcing segregation was unconstitutional. In 1944, the Court ruled that the Fifteenth Amendment barred Texas from running an all-white primary election. In 1948, it stopped enforcement of covenants that home buyers signed that said they would not resell their houses to blacks or Jews.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_009"><em class="emphasis">Mitchell v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s03_p02">Marshall decided to force the justices to address the issue of segregation directly. He brought suit against school facilities for blacks that were physically equal to those for whites. With the 1954 decision, <em class="emphasis">Brown v.

Such organizations provided networks for communicating with and organizing recruits. The black press in both the North and the South publicized the movement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p02">Daily newspapers in the South, which covered a white power structure and were aimed at white readers, all but ignored the African American civil rights movement.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p03">The first mass action for civil rights took place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1953. African Americans led by a Baptist minister boycotted the city’s segregated public buses. Although African Americans provided about three-quarters of the ridership, they had to stand behind an often near-empty white section. A deal was struck: the city council saved the first two rows for whites but blacks could sit anywhere else, as long as they were not in front of whites.</p>

                <p class="simpara">Rosa Parks</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p05">Two enduring images of the African American civil rights movement are of Rosa Parks. In one, she is being arrested. In a later photograph taken for <em class="emphasis">Look</em> magazine, she is sitting on a city bus <em class="emphasis">in front of</em> a white passenger. Her refusal to give up her bus seat to a white person and move to the back of the bus touched off the massive Montgomery bus boycott that ended with a Supreme Court decision ordering the city to desegregate public transportation. The images endure because of the simple, moving tale of a lone individual affirming her dignity and equality by a simple act—sitting down.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p06">What the images do not show is that Parks was a longstanding activist in local civil rights politics and was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. The photo of her arrest was not for her action on the bus, but for later activity in the boycott.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p07">Parks was not the first African American woman to refuse to give up her seat in a bus. Claudette Colvin, a fifteen-year-old young woman active in the NAACP Youth Council, had refused to give up her bus seat a few months before. Colvin cried out as she was arrested, “this is my constitutional right.” NAACP leaders had hoped to draw attention to Colvin’s case, until they realized that she was foul-mouthed and unruly—the pregnant, unmarried Colvin was not the symbol of African American resistance the NAACP wished to portray. Parks, a diminutive, devout, soft-spoken, married woman, was ideal for favorable publicity.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_013">Douglas Brinkley, <em class="emphasis">Rosa Parks</em> (New York: Viking Penguin, 2000), chap. 5.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p08">Civil rights activists receive most positive coverage when they are able to present themselves as noble, oppressed victims. The images of Parks, arrested and sitting at the front of the bus, have lasted and been widely reproduced. Other images of Parks as political activist and organizer, roles that are equally central to her life, have not.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p09">King founded the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sclcnational.org">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) to lead black resistance, confirmed himself as the leading orator of the movement, and honed a strategy by which black victims of discrimination confronted repressive white power nonviolently. Rosa Parks’s example revealed how this “David-and-Goliath” story was well suited to getting the issue of civil rights into the news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p10">Students created the next wave of activism. In 1960, four freshmen at North Carolina A&amp;T State University sat down at a dime-store, whites-only lunch counter in Greensboro and would not leave until they were served.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p11">The students tipped off a local white photographer, who took a picture of them that gained national attention. The “Greensboro four” were arrested and jailed. Twenty-nine students sat at the lunch counter the next day, and hundreds more followed. After months of dwindling sales, Greensboro’s merchants agreed to desegregate. The sit-in was rapidly imitated across the South.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_014">William H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p12">In 1961, white and black activists launched a Freedom Ride to travel together on buses from Washington, DC, to New Orleans in defiance of state laws. They did not make it. In Alabama, one bus was stopped, and its occupants were badly beaten. Another bus was set on fire, and the freedom riders barely escaped alive.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p13">Dramatic, widely distributed photographs of these events forced President John F. Kennedy to order federal agencies to halt segregation and discrimination in interstate transportation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_015">David Niven, <em class="emphasis">The Politics of Injustice: The Kennedys, the Freedom Rides, and the Electoral Consequences of a Moral Compromise</em> (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2003).</span> Civil rights activists used depictions of white repression to win dramatic news coverage and generate public sympathy for their cause.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p14">The SNCC organized the Freedom Summer of 1964, a campaign to register voters in Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage of blacks and the lowest rate of black voter registration. Massive resistance from whites resulted in violence, culminating in the murder of three civil rights workers—one black and two white. Murders of white civil rights activists generated more public outrage and received more news coverage than murders of black participants.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p15">In 1963, King and the SCLC conducted an all-out campaign, including mass meetings, sit-ins, and boycotts of downtown stores in Birmingham, Alabama. Their attempts to march to city hall were violently suppressed by police. Marchers, including young children, were chased and attacked by police dogs and pummeled with water from fire hoses so powerful it tore off their clothes and removed bark from trees. Thousands were arrested.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s04_p16">These protests, and the official response, received saturation coverage in the news.

Eskew, <em class="emphasis">But For Birmingham: The Local and National Movements in the Civil Rights Struggle</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997).</span> In a nationally televised address in June, President Kennedy proposed a far-reaching Civil Rights Act. Riding a surge of attention, King planned a national march on Washington.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s05_p01">After the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963, the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, asked Congress to pass the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/civil-rights-act-1.html">Civil Rights Act</a>, which Kennedy had initiated.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s05_p02">The Civil Rights Act forbids discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin” in public accommodations and employment. It set up the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeoc.gov">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) to implement the law.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s05_p03">With the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the movement turned from discrimination to the vote. Southern blacks trying to register to vote were required to answer impossible questions, such as “how many bubbles in a bar of soap?” Those who managed to register and then tried to vote might be beaten or fired from their jobs. King and the SCLC marched on Selma, Alabama, to peacefully push the goal of registering black citizens to vote. Such a simple message was ideal for transmission through the national news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s05_p04">In March of 1965, King organized a march from Selma to the state capital, Montgomery. A column of six hundred marchers were confronted by fifty Alabama state troopers, some on horseback, and ordered to disperse. When they did not move, the troopers charged them and shot tear gas, brutally injuring one hundred of the demonstrators. Television footage of this “Bloody Sunday” was widely broadcast.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s05_p05">The upsurge in news coverage prompted membership and funding for civil rights organizations to soar. Public opinion polls revealed that civil rights was the nation’s most important problem.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_017">Tom W. Smith, “America’s Most Important Problem—A Trend Analysis, <em class="emphasis">Public Opinion Quarterly</em> 44, no. 2 (Summer 1980): 164–80.</span> Officials felt pressure to act. President Johnson gave a televised speech before Congress to propose the Voting Rights Act, stating, “It is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.” He paused, then evoked the civil rights battle cry: “We shall overcome.” The act sailed through Congress. (See Johnson speak at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3386">http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3386</a>.)</p>

The act outlawed literacy tests and required the states to prove to the justice department that any changes in voting practices would not abridge the right to vote. It authorized the federal government to use poll watchers and registration examiners to supervise state and local elections. It instantly removed barriers to black registration and voting. In Mississippi, the percentage of blacks registered to vote swelled from under 7 percent in 1964 to 60 percent in 1967.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s06_p01">Victorious in the South, the African American civil rights movement turned north. Blacks and whites were separated by locality and attended different schools in both North and South. Separation of the races in the North was by practice more than by law; such <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">de facto segregation</a><span class="glossdef">Separation of the races that occurs by social practice.</span></span> proved tougher to address by legal efforts alone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s06_p02">African Americans began rioting in Northern cities, and the rioting reached a peak in 1967. Many rioters saw their actions as protest or rebellion. Some of their violence targeted white-owned stores, which they looted, and police stations, which they set on fire. Scores of African Americans died after police and soldiers were brought in to restore order.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s06_p03">In part due to their perennial interest in vivid, dramatic conflict, the media shifted their focus from nobly suffering victims to fiery, demanding militants. The unity, discipline, and influence of the African American civil rights movement ebbed. King’s doctrine of nonviolent resistance was challenged by the rhetoric of the Black Muslim leader Malcolm X who advocated “any means necessary” to advance equality and promoted SNCC’s new motto, “Black Power.” In 1968, King was assassinated in Memphis, where he had gone to support the sanitation workers’ campaign for improved pay and working conditions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s06_p04">Black militancy, amplified in the news, spawned a white backlash. Republican Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968 on a “law and order” platform that called for slowing down desegregation. The news prominently displayed the dramatic, sometimes violent, reaction by whites against the busing of black students to white schools in supposedly liberal Northern cities such as Boston. It did not miss the irony of massive demonstrations against the busing to desegregate the public schools of Boston, the city at the center of the opposition to slavery prior to the Civil War.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s06_p05">In 1974, the Supreme Court rejected a Detroit plan that required busing across school district lines.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s07_p01">In recent years, the main mass-media focus on African American civil rights has been <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affirmative action</a><span class="glossdef">Efforts made or enforced by government to increase percentages of racial and ethnic minorities, and women, in higher education and the workplace.</span></span>: efforts made or enforced by government to achieve equality of opportunity by increasing the percentages of racial and ethnic minorities and women in higher education and the workplace.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s07_p02">Most members of racial and ethnic minorities support affirmative action; majorities of whites are opposed. Supporters tend to focus on remedying the effects of past discrimination; opponents respond that government should never discriminate on the basis of race. The media largely frame the issue as a question of one side winning and the other side losing.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_019">Robert M. Entman and Andrew Rojecki, <em class="emphasis">The Black Image in the White Mind: Media and Race in America</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s07_p03">The Supreme Court first weighed in on affirmative action in 1978. Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was denied entrance to the medical school of the University of California, Davis. Bakke noted that his test scores were higher than other applicants admitted on a separate track for minorities. He sued, charging “reverse discrimination.” The Court concluded that UC Davis’s approach of separating white and minority applicants into two separate groups violated the principle of equal protection. School programs like Harvard’s, which considered race as one of many criteria, were permissible.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_020"><em class="emphasis">Regents of the University of California v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s07_p04">A 2003 Supreme Court decision affirmed this position by voiding the undergraduate admission program at the University of Michigan that added points to a candidate’s application on the basis of race but upholding the graduate admission approach that considered race in a less quantitative way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s07_p05">In 2007, the Supreme Court rejected the actions of the Seattle and Louisville school systems to promote racial integration by assigning students to particular schools in order to make the population of each school reflect the cities’ racial composition. This 5–4 decision by Chief Justice Roberts, leading the Court’s conservative majority, seemed to prohibit school systems from using race to classify and thus assign students. It did, however, allow the use of other (unspecified) race-conscious measures to combat racial segregation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_021"><em class="emphasis">Parents Involved in Community Schools v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s08_p01">The legacy of slavery and segregation is evident in not only the higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and incarceration but also the lower life expectancy and educational test scores of African Americans compared to whites. Visitors to the website of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.naacp.org">NAACP</a> will find many subjects connected to race, such as police practices of racial profiling of suspects. But the NAACP also deals with issues that disproportionately affect African Americans and that some might think have “nothing to do with race.” These include a practice the NAACP labels “environmental racism,” whereby polluting factories are placed next to poor, largely African American neighborhoods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s08_p02">The mass media tend to focus on incidents of overt discrimination rather than on damage caused by the poverty, poor education, and environmental hazards that disadvantaged groups often face. This media frame explains why television reporters, facing the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina, were so thunderstruck by the overwhelming number of black faces among the victims. The topic of black urban poverty is simply not something the press routinely covers.</p>

We described the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the issue of affirmative action. African Americans have had more success in combating segregation by law than fighting discrimination by practice. They have variously been helped and hindered by media coverage and depictions of their situation and struggles. Civil rights issues persist today.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Many landmark cases on racial discrimination going back to the nineteenth century stemmed from suits by Asian Americans. World War II brought more discrimination out of an unjustified, if not irrational, fear that some Japanese Americans might be loyal to Japan and thus commit acts of sabotage against the United States: the federal government imposed curfews on them. Then after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans (62 percent of them US citizens) were forcibly moved from their homes to distant, desolate relocation camps. Ruling toward the end of the war, the Supreme Court did not strike down the internment policy, but it did hold that classifying people by race is unconstitutional.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_026"><em class="emphasis">Korematsu v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p01">Native Americans represent many tribes with distinct languages, cultures, and traditions. Nowadays, they obtain protection against discrimination just as members of other racial and ethnic groups do. Specifically, the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) of 1968 guaranteed them many civil rights, including equal protection under the law and due process; freedom of speech, press, and assembly; and protection from unreasonable search and seizure, self-incrimination, and double jeopardy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Native Americans’ civil rights issues today center on tribal autonomy and self-government on Indian reservations. Thus some of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as the separation of church and state, do not apply to tribes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_030"><em class="emphasis">Talton v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p03">For much of history, Native Americans residing outside of reservations were in a legal limbo, being neither members of self-governing tribal nations nor US citizens. For example, in 1881, John Elk, a Native American living in Omaha, claimed that he was denied equal protection of the laws when he was prevented from voting. The Supreme Court ruled that since he was “born to an Indian nation,” Elk was not a citizen and could not claim a right to vote.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_031"><em class="emphasis">Elk v.

Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, outlawing sex discrimination in federally funded educational programs, prompted little debate when it was enacted. Today it is controversial.

It passed by huge bipartisan margins in the House in 1970 and the Senate in 1972; thirty of the thirty-eight states necessary to ratify approved it almost immediately. However, opposition to the ERA, led and generated by conservative women, arose among the general public, including women. While women working outside the home generally favored the ERA to fight job discrimination, housewives feared that the ERA would remove protection for them, such as the legal presumptions that women were more eligible than men for alimony after a divorce. The public’s support of the ERA declined because of fears that it might allow military conscription of women and gay marriage. The political consensus crumbled, and in 1980, the Republican platform opposed ERA for the first time. ERA died in 1982 when the ratification process expired.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_040">Jane S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_p01">Gay people, lesbians and gay men, are at the forefront of controversial civil rights battles today. They have won civil rights in several areas but not in others.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_044">Gary Mucciaroni, <em class="emphasis">Same Sex, Different Politics: Success and Failure in the Struggle over Gay Rights</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008); and Paul Brewer, <em class="emphasis">Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights</em> (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_p02">Gay people face unique obstacles in attaining civil rights. Unlike race or gender, sexual orientation may or may not be an “accident of birth” that merits constitutional protection. The gay rights movement is opposed by religious conservatives, who see homosexuality as a flawed behavior, not an innate characteristic. Moreover, gay people are not “born into” a visible community and identity into which they are socialized. A history of ostracism prompts many to conceal their identities. According to many surveys of gay people, they experience discrimination and violence, actual or threatened.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_p03">Election exit polls estimate that lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals make up 4 percent of the voting public.

For instance, the public overwhelmingly condemns discrimination against gay people in the workplace.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s01_p01">The anti-Communist scare in the early 1950s spilled into worries about “sexual perverts” in government. Gay people faced harassment from city mayors and police departments pressured to “clean up” their cities of “vice.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s01_p02">The first gay rights movement, the small, often secretive Mattachine Society, emerged to respond to these threats. Mattachine’s leaders argued that gay people, rather than adjust to society, should fight discrimination against them with collective identity and pride. Emulating the African American civil rights movement, they protested and confronted authorities.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_046">John D’Emilio, <em class="emphasis">Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority, 1940–1970</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983).

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s01_p03">In June 1969, during a police raid at a gay bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Inn, customers fought back. Street protests and violent outbursts followed over several days and catalyzed a mass movement. The Stonewall riots were overlooked by network television and at best got only derisive coverage in the back pages of most newspapers. But discussion of the riot and the grievances of gay people blossomed in alternative newspapers such as <em class="emphasis">The Village Voice</em> and emerging weeklies serving gay urban enclaves. By the mid-1970s, a national newsmagazine, <em class="emphasis">The Advocate</em>, had been founded.</p>

Drawing on this new openness, media discussion in both news and entertainment grew dramatically from the 1950s through the 1960s.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p01">In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton endorsed lifting the ban on gay people serving openly in the military. In a postelection press conference, Clinton said he would sign an executive order to do so. The news media, seeing a dramatic and clear-cut story, kept after this issue, which became the top concern of Clinton’s first days in office. The military and key members of Congress launched a public relations campaign against Clinton’s stand, highlighted by a media event at which legislators toured cramped submarines and asked sailors on board how they felt about serving with gay people. Clinton ultimately supported a compromise that was closer to a surrender—a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that has had the effect of substantially increasing the number of discharges from the military for homosexuality.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_052">Craig A.

President Obama urged repeal, as did his secretary of defense and leaders of the military. In December 2010, Congress passed and the president signed legislation repealing “don’t ask, don’t tell.” As the president put it in his 2011 State of the Union message, “Our troops come from every corner of this country—they are black, white, Latino, Asian, and Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And yes, we know that some of them are gay.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p01">Same-sex couples brought suits in state courts on the grounds that preventing them from marrying was sex discrimination barred by their state constitutions. In 1996, Hawaii’s state supreme court agreed. Many members of Congress, concerned that officials might be forced by the Constitution’s “full faith and credit” clause to recognize same-sex marriages from Hawaii, quickly passed a Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed. It defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman and denies same-sex couples federal benefits for married people. Many states followed suit, and Hawaii’s court decision was nullified when the state’s voters amended the state constitution before it could take effect.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p02">In 2000, the highest state court in Vermont ruled that the state may not discriminate against same-sex couples and allowed the legislature to create <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil unions</a><span class="glossdef">Alternative to same-sex marriage, whereby a state does not allow same-sex couples to legally marry but allows them to apply for legal recognition of their relationship; this gives them the rights and privileges of marriage in that state.</span></span>. These give same-sex couples “marriage lite” benefits such as inheritance rights. Going further, in 2003, Massachusetts’s highest state court allowed same-sex couples to legally wed. So did the California and Connecticut Supreme Courts in 2008.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p03">Voters in thirty states, including California in 2008 (by 52 percent of the vote), passed amendments to their state constitutions banning same-sex marriage. President George W. Bush endorsed an amendment to the US Constitution restricting marriage and its benefits to opposite-sex couples. It received a majority of votes in the House, but not the two-thirds required.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p04">In 2010, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down California’s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage on the grounds that it discriminates against gay men and women. In 2011 New York allowed same-sex marriage. The legal battle is almost certain to be settled by the US Supreme Court.</p>

According to these policies, disabilities were viewed as medical problems; rehabilitation was stressed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s06_s01_p02">By the 1960s, Congress began shifting toward civil rights by enacting a law requiring new federal construction to be designed to allow entrance for people with disabilities. In 1972, Congress voted, without debate, that work and school programs receiving federal funds could not deny benefits to or discriminate against someone “solely by reason of his handicap.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_054">Richard K.

In the workplace, this means that facilities must be made accessible (e.g., by means of wheelchair ramps), responsibilities restructured, or policies altered so that someone with disabilities can do a job. At schools, it entails extra time for tests and assignments for those with learning disabilities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s06_s01_p03">The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ada.gov">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) passed Congress by a large margin and was signed into law in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush. The act moves away from the “medical model” by defining disability as including a physical or mental impairment that limits a “major life activity.” It gives the disabled a right of access to public building. It prohibits discrimination in employment against those who, given reasonable opportunity, could perform the essential functions of a job.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s06_s01_p04">However, the courts interpreted the law and its definition of disability narrowly; for example, to exclude people with conditions that could be mitigated (e.g., by a hearing aid or artificial limb), controlled by medication, or were in remission.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s06_s01_p05">In response, on September 29, 2008, President Bush signed legislation overturning the Supreme Court’s decisions.

Latinos have gained language but not immigration rights. After the horror of relocation inflicted on Japanese Americans, Asian Americans have obtained their rights, although vestiges of discrimination remain. Rights issues for Native Americans concern tribal autonomy and self-government. Women have gained less civil rights protection, in part because of policy disagreements among women and because of fear of undermining men’s and women’s traditional roles. Gay people have won protections against discrimination in states and localities and through the courts, but have been denied equality in marriage. People with disabilities have won civil rights protections through national legislative and executive action.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s01_p02">Demonstrations, marches, and protests are one way to respond, although they can quickly become “old news.” Some activists end up conducting larger and more militant protests in order to get covered, but this can be detrimental. After 1965, for example, the African American civil rights movement divided, as some participants embraced the confrontational, even inflammatory rhetoric of the “Black Power” movement. Coverage of militancy easily turns negative, so activists have learned to anticipate the needs of the news media and become more disciplined when they plan their activities. As a result, they may downplay controversial issues and stress less sweeping policy changes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s01_p03">Members of disadvantaged groups are quick to see the media acting as <em class="emphasis">agents of</em> discrimination, reinforcing derogatory stereotypes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_057">For an exhaustive catalog of stereotypes, see Stephanie Greco Larson, <em class="emphasis">Media and Minorities</em> (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005).</span> They therefore monitor media content and apply pressure on both news and entertainment media to influence how their members are portrayed.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_058">Kathryn C. Montgomery, <em class="emphasis">Target Prime Time: Advocacy Groups and the Struggle over Entertainment Television</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989).</span> They threaten boycotts of media companies and advertisers. One of the first endeavors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was to protest against D. W. Griffith’s feature film <em class="emphasis">Birth of a Nation</em> (1913), which portrayed African Americans after the Civil War as stupid and venal and celebrated the Ku Klux Klan. Even if the controversy does not end in a withdrawal of the offensive material, it sensitizes media executives to the risks of potentially inflammatory programming.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s01_p04">Targets of public criticism may respond by reforming their depictions. Griffith himself was stung by the accusations of insensitivity. His next film, <em class="emphasis">Intolerance</em> (1916), is an eloquent epic combining multiple stories across the ages to plead for understanding between groups. More recently, director Jonathan Demme faced protests from lesbian and gay groups over his film <em class="emphasis">Silence of the Lambs</em>, whose villain was a seductive, murderous cross-dresser. In response, Demme’s next film, <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia</em>, featured Tom Hanks as a sympathetic gay man with AIDS who sues the law firm that fired him.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p01">Through old and new media, disadvantaged groups can reach out and mobilize among themselves in favor of civil rights.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p02">Supportive media have long prospered in one old technology: newsprint. Newspapers aimed at black readers date back to <em class="emphasis">Freedom’s Journal</em>, a newspaper founded in 1827 in New York to rebut the racist claims of other newspapers. Today the black press, ranging from small local weeklies to glossy high-circulation national magazines like <em class="emphasis">Ebony</em> and <em class="emphasis">Jet</em>, continues the tradition. It provides news items that might otherwise go unnoticed in the mainstream media and also adds information and interpretation about ongoing stories explicitly taking the interests and viewpoints of African Americans into account.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_059">Susan Herbst, <em class="emphasis">Politics at the Margin: Historical Studies of Public Expression Outside the Mainstream</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), chap. 3.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p03">The burgeoning number of foreign-language daily and weekly newspapers (many of them also online), which serve other racial and ethnic minorities, are among the few gaining readership today. Many are small, independent operations; others are offshoots of established newspapers such as <em class="emphasis">El Nuevo Herald</em> in Miami or <em class="emphasis">Viet Mercury</em> in San Jose. They often provide information and perspectives that challenge narrow or stereotypical coverage. Magazines such as <em class="emphasis">Ms.</em> enable women to address each other about political concerns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p04">News and entertainment cable channels serving disadvantaged groups include Oxygen for women, Black Entertainment Television for African Americans, and Logo for gay people. The small “indie” subsidiaries of Hollywood studios in 2005 produced two Oscar finalists with challenging content: <em class="emphasis">Crash</em> on race and <em class="emphasis">Brokeback Mountain</em> on sexual orientation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Going Online</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s03_p01">There are numerous resources online that can inform disadvantaged individuals and groups about their civil rights. Websites such as Civilrights.org, sponsored by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, provide up-to-date information about a wide range of issues, such as how homeowners with disabilities can protect their homes during an economic downturn. Rich resources recounting the struggles for civil rights throughout history are available online, including the Library of Congress’s <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civilrights/cr-exhibit.html">Voices of Civil Rights</a>, an online exhibition of thousands of documents, oral histories, photos, and news reports on the African American civil rights movement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_s03_p02">Disadvantaged groups use digital media to mobilize an often far-flung constituency and spark action for civil rights. They organize online communities on Facebook to share information and concerns. They use e-mail alerts and text messages to keep their supporters abreast of the latest developments and to call them to action when needed. They orchestrate blast e-mail messages and online petitions urging members of Congress to support their cause.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Consequences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">The media sometimes sympathetically depict and amplify disadvantaged groups’ demands for civil rights, especially when they are voiced by individuals who ask only for equality of opportunity and to be judged on their own merits. Coverage is unfavorable when it frames the demands as undeserved or requiring special privileges or the issue as a conflict in which one side will win and the other lose. The media’s frame of interracial conflict increases racial divides on affirmative action. If affirmative action is presented in terms that are less stark than win-lose or either-or, whites’ views become more favorable.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_060">Paul M. Sniderman and Thomas Piazza, <em class="emphasis">The Scar of Race</em> (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1993).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p02">Civil rights issues often make the news in the form of dramatic, unexpected events. Two widely publicized <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hate crime</a><span class="glossdef">An attack on a minority because of his or her race or sexual orientation, which sometimes results in death.</span></span> murders from 1999 drew attention to these issues. James Byrd Jr., an African American, was chained to the back of a truck and dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas. Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student was beaten, tied to a remote fence in Laramie, and left to die. These murders provoked massive attention to the threat of violence against African Americans and gay men.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p03">Televised docudramas were made about both cases. The media’s constant images of the dusty back roads of Jasper and the buck-and-rail fence outside Laramie evoked images of the old South and the Wild West. These media depictions sparked debates about the persistence of discrimination. But they presented it is an isolated problem, and not one that concerns mainstream America.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p04">The media can depict members of disadvantaged groups positively to the public. Given that most Americans are surrounded by and interact with people like themselves, such visibility can push toward understanding and tolerance. Perhaps the most notable example of this effect is the shift in the portrayals of gay people in the mass media.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_061">Larry Gross, <em class="emphasis">Up from Invisibility: Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Media in America</em> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001); Suzanna Danuta Walters, <em class="emphasis">All the Rage: The Story of Gay Visibility in America</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001).</span> Positive images appeared on television series, such as <em class="emphasis">Will and Grace</em>. Familiar, openly gay showbiz personalities appear on talk shows, including Ellen DeGeneres, who <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“came out of the closet”</a><span class="glossdef">Gay or lesbian individuals who, having previously denied or concealed their sexual orientation, now publicly announce it.</span></span> in real life and in playing her character in her situation comedy <em class="emphasis">Ellen</em>. She subsequently hosted a talk show of her own. Such depictions create a climate of tolerance in which gay people are more comfortable being open. As a result, more Americans report knowing someone who is gay, which in turn increases their support for equal treatment.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_062">On the dynamics of public opinion, see Alan S. Yang, “The Polls—Trends: Attitudes Toward Homosexuality,” <em class="emphasis">Public Opinion Quarterly</em> 61, no. 3 (1997): 477–507; and <em class="emphasis">From Wrongs to Rights, 1973–1999: Public Opinion on Gay and Lesbian Americans Moves Toward Equality</em> (New York: Policy Institute, The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 2001).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p05">In this section we showed that the media are a potential resource for disadvantaged groups to energize their members, sway public opinion, and achieve their policy objectives. Such groups may engage in behavior that attracts media attention; they may monitor and try to influence media coverage. Disadvantaged groups also benefit from their own media and through their use of digital media. Depictions in the mass media can be unfavorable—for example, when a group’s demands are framed as undeserved or requiring special privileges—or favorable, as in portrayals of gays on television entertainment shows.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p06">High school students in and around Los Angeles walked out of class on Friday, March 24 and Monday, March 27, 2006. They were protesting legislation passed by the House of Representatives to criminalize illegal immigration and any sort of aid to illegal immigrants. Through mass media coverage of the walkout they were able to raise their concerns in their own terms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_063">See Cynthia H. Cho and Anna Gorman, “Massive Student Walkout Spreads Across Southland,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, March 28, 2006, A1; Teresa Watanabe and Hector Becerra, “How DJs Put 500,000 Marchers in Motion,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, March 28, 2006, A10.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p07">As the example of the high school students shows, schools can be a fertile ground for civil rights activism. Civil rights are especially pertinent to institutions of higher learning. Public universities and colleges must be operated according to the Fourteenth Amendment’s demand that governments provide “equal protection of the law.” Private universities and colleges are subject to civil rights laws, since the vast majority of them receive federal funds.</p>
