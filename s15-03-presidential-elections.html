    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_p02">The presidential election gets the most prominent American campaign. It lasts the longest and receives far more attention from the media than any other election. The Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born US citizen, at least thirty-five years old when taking office, and a resident of the United States for at least fourteen years. It imposed no limits on the number of presidential terms, but the first president, George Washington, established a precedent by leaving office after two terms. This stood until President Franklin D. Roosevelt won a third term in 1940 and a fourth in 1944. Congress then proposed, and the states ratified, the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution, which limited the president’s term of office to two terms.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Caucuses and Primaries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Becoming a political party’s presidential nominee requires obtaining a majority of the delegates at the party’s national nominating convention. Delegates are party regulars, both average citizens who are active in party organizations and officeholders, who attend the national nominating conventions and choose the presidential nominee. The parties allocate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">convention delegates</a><span class="glossdef">Party regulars who attend the national nominating conventions and choose the presidential nominee.</span></span> to the states, the District of Columbia, and to US foreign territories based mainly on their total populations and past records of electing the party’s candidates. The Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are the most important, as third-party candidates rarely are serious contenders in presidential elections.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p02">Most candidates begin building a campaign organization, raising money, soliciting support, and courting the media months, even years, before the first vote is cast. Soon after the president is inaugurated, the press begins speculating about who might run in the next presidential election. Potential candidates test the waters to see if their campaign is viable and if they have a chance to make a serious bid for the presidency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Delegates to the party nominating conventions are selected through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">caucuses</a><span class="glossdef">Meetings of party members at which delegates to the nominating convention are selected; these delegates then decide on the party’s nominee, who will run in the general election.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primaries</a><span class="glossdef">Elections in which party members vote for delegates to the nominating convention; these delegates then choose the party’s nominee, who will enter the general election.</span></span>. Some states hold caucuses, often lengthy meetings of the party faithful who choose delegates to the party’s nominating convention. The first delegates are selected in the Iowa caucuses in January. Most convention delegates are chosen in primary elections in states. Delegates are allocated proportionally to the candidates who receive the most votes in the state. New Hampshire holds the first primary in January, ten months before the general election. More and more states <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">front-load primaries</a><span class="glossdef">Primaries that states hold early in the process in order to increase their influence over who secures the presidential nomination.</span></span>—hold them early in the process—to increase their influence on the presidential nomination. Candidates and the media focus on the early primaries because winning them gives a campaign momentum.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p04">The Democrats also have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">super delegates</a><span class="glossdef">Delegates to the Democratic National Convention who are party luminaries, members of the Democratic National Committee, governors, and members of Congress.

Super delegates are party luminaries, members of the National Committee, governors, and members of Congress. At the 2008 Democratic convention they made up approximately 18 percent of the delegates.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The National Party Conventions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p01">The Democratic and Republican parties hold their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national nominating conventions</a><span class="glossdef">Meetings held by political parties to formalize the selection of their candidates for president and vice president and to establish a party platform</span></span> toward the end of the summer of every presidential election year to formally select the presidential and vice presidential candidates. The party of the incumbent president holds its convention last. Conventions are designed to inspire, unify, and mobilize the party faithful as well as to encourage people who are undecided, independent, or supporting the other party to vote for its candidates.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_024">Costas Panagopoulos, ed., <em class="emphasis">Rewiring Politics: Presidential Nominating Conventions in the Media Age</em> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007).</span> Conventions also approve the party’s platform containing its policy positions, proposals, and promises.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Selecting the party’s nominees for president and vice president is potentially the most important and exciting function of national conventions. But today, conventions are coronations as the results are already determined by the caucuses and primaries. The last presidential candidate not victorious on the first ballot was Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1952. The last nominee who almost lacked enough delegates to win on the first ballot was President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p03">Presidential candidates choose the vice presidential candidate, who is approved by the convention. The vice presidential candidate is selected based on a number of criteria. He or she might have experience that compliments that of the presidential nominee, such as being an expert on foreign affairs while the presidential nominee concentrates on domestic issues. The vice presidential nominee might balance the ticket ideologically or come from a battleground state with many electoral votes. The choice for a vice presidential candidate can sometimes be met with dissent from party members.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p04">Modern-day conventions are carefully orchestrated by the parties to display the candidates at their best and to demonstrate enthusiasm for the nominee. The media provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of conventions and replay highlights. As a result, candidates receive a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">postconvention “bounce”</a><span class="glossdef">A temporary increase in opinion-poll standings experienced by presidential nominees immediately following the national nominating convention.</span></span> as their standing in the polls goes up temporarily just as the general election begins.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Electoral College</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p01">The president and vice president are chosen by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Electoral College</a><span class="glossdef">The 538 electors who choose the president and vice president by majority vote.</span></span> as specified in the Constitution. Voters do not directly elect the president but choose electors—representatives from their state who meet in December to select the president and vice president. To win the presidency, a candidate must obtain a majority of the electors, at least 270 out of the 538 total. The statewide winner-take-all by state system obliges them to put much of their time and money into swing states where the contest is close. Except for Maine and Nebraska, states operate under a winner-take-all system: the candidate with the most votes cast in the state, even if fewer than a majority, receives all its electoral votes.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p03">It is possible to win the election without winning the popular vote, as George W. Bush did in 2000 with about half a million fewer votes than Democrat Al Gore. The Electoral College decision depended on who won the popular vote in Florida, where voting was contested due to problems with ballots and voting machines. The voting in Florida was so close that the almost two hundred thousand ballots thrown out far exceeded Bush’s margin of victory of a few hundred votes.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p04">Presidential elections involve caucuses, primaries, the national party convention, the general election, and the Electoral College. Presidential hopefuls vie to be their party’s nominee by collecting delegates through state caucuses and primaries. Delegates attend their party’s national nominating convention to select the presidential nominee. The presidential candidate selects his vice presidential running mate who is approved at the convention. Voters in the general election select electors to the Electoral College who select the president and vice president. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote and lose the general election.</p>
