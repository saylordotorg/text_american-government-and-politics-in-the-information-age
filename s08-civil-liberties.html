        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s00_p01">The mass media are obsessed with law and order. Police shows and news about the police abound. The opening voice-over of the Fox television network series <em class="emphasis">Cops</em> intones that the show “is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement.” Camera crews accompany police officers through the streets of America’s cities, shooting many hours of real-life video to edit down to half-hour programs showing police catching culprits. The police officers are the only narrators. Series producers say, “The goal is to put you in the passenger seat with them so you can experience what it is like to be a cop.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_001">Quoted in Aaron Doyle, “‘Cops’: Television Policing as Policing Reality,” in <em class="emphasis">Entertaining Crime: Television Reality Programs</em>, ed. Mark Fishman and Gray Cavender (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1998), 95–116, quote at 101.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s00_p02"><em class="emphasis">Cops</em>’ approach to criminal justice is summarized in its theme music: “Bad boys, bad boys, what’cha gonna do? What’cha gonna do when they come for you?” The outcome is always the same: the “bad boys” (and bad girls) are shown to be criminals deserving to be hauled in. The end of each episode reassures us that the police are working hard to stop crime. Other central concerns of American politics—and specifically the civil liberties of individuals—are submerged. Suspects are seldom informed of their rights, rarely request a lawyer, and are not “presumed innocent until proven guilty.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s00_p03">Civil liberties do appear in the media. The news media sometimes spotlight police abuses of people’s liberties: for example, in 1991 they repeatedly aired a clip of Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King violently with their batons—an incident that was caught on videotape by a bystander. A familiar plot in fiction is the plight of the wrongly accused.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s00_p04">Indeed, the media are often stalwart defenders of civil liberties because freedom of the press is so crucial to their own activities. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Civil liberties</a><span class="glossdef">The rights and freedoms of individuals that government may not infringe on, mostly listed in the Bill of Rights.</span></span> are the rights and freedoms of individuals that the Constitution says government should not infringe on. What these freedoms entail is much disputed in American politics and affects a wide range of policies.</p>

        <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_p01">After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_l01">
            <li>What is the Bill of Rights?</li>
            <li>What historical periods were central to the evolution of civil liberties protections?</li>
            <li>What is the relationship of the Fourteenth Amendment to civil liberties?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_p02">The foundation of civil liberties is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bill of Rights</a><span class="glossdef">The first ten amendments to the Constitution, adopted in 1789 and ratified in 1791.</span></span>, the ten amendments added to the Constitution in 1791 to restrict what the national government may do.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_p03">The state conventions that ratified the Constitution obtained promises that the new Congress would consider adding a Bill of Rights. James Madison—the key figure in the Constitutional Convention and an exponent of the Constitution’s logic in the Federalist papers—was elected to the first House of Representatives. Keeping a campaign promise, he surveyed suggestions from state-ratifying conventions and zeroed in on those most often recommended. He wrote the amendments not just as goals to pursue but as commands telling the national government what it must do or what it cannot do. Congress passed twelve amendments, but the Bill of Rights shrank to ten when the first two (concerning congressional apportionment and pay) were not ratified by the necessary nine states.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_p05">The first eight amendments that were adopted address particular rights. The Ninth Amendment addressed the concern that listing some rights might undercut unspoken natural rights that preceded government. It states that the Bill of Rights does not “deny or disparage others retained by the people.” This allows for unnamed rights, such as the right to travel between states, to be recognized. We discussed the Tenth Amendment in <a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch03#paletz_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Federalism"</a>, as it has more to do with states’ rights than individual rights.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rights</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Even before the addition of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution did not ignore civil liberties entirely. It states that Congress cannot restrict one’s right to request a writ of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">habeas corpus</a><span class="glossdef">A writ issued by a judge asking the government for the reasons for a person’s arrest; the Constitution protects an individual’s right to ask for such a writ.</span></span> giving the reasons for one’s arrest. It bars Congress and the states from enacting <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bills of attainder</a><span class="glossdef">Laws prohibited by the Constitution that punish a named individual without judicial proceedings.</span></span> (laws punishing a named person without trial) or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ex post facto laws</a><span class="glossdef">Laws prohibited by the Constitution that retroactively make a legal act a crime.</span></span> (laws retrospectively making actions illegal). It specifies that persons accused by the national government of a crime have a right to trial by jury in the state where the offense is alleged to have occurred and that national and state officials cannot be subjected to a “religious test,” such as swearing allegiance to a particular denomination.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p02">The Bill of Rights contains the bulk of civil liberties. Unlike the Constitution, with its emphasis on powers and structures, the Bill of Rights speaks of “the people,” and it outlines the rights that are central to individual freedom.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_002">This section draws on Robert A. Goldwin, <em class="emphasis">From Parchment to Power</em> (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1997).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p03">The main amendments fall into several broad categories of protection:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Freedom of expression (I)</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p01">The first big dispute over civil liberties erupted when Congress passed the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html">Sedition Act</a> in 1798, amid tension with revolutionary France. The act made false and malicious criticisms of the government—including Federalist president John Adams and Congress—a crime. While printers could not be stopped from publishing, because of freedom of the press, they could be punished after publication. The Adams administration and Federalist judges used the act to threaten with arrest and imprisonment many Republican editors who opposed them. Republicans argued that freedom of the press, before or after publication, was crucial to giving the people the information they required in a republic. The Sedition Act was a key issue in the 1800 presidential election, which was won by the Republican Thomas Jefferson over Adams; the act expired at the end of Adams’s term.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_004">See James Morton Smith, <em class="emphasis">Freedom’s Fetters: The Alien and Sedition Laws and American Civil Liberties</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1956). For how the reaction to the Sedition Act produced a broader understanding of freedom of the press than the Bill of Rights intended, see Leonard W. Levy, <em class="emphasis">Emergence of a Free Press</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p02">Debates over slavery also expanded civil liberties. By the mid-1830s, Northerners were publishing newspapers favoring slavery’s abolition. President Andrew Jackson proposed stopping the US Post Office from mailing such “incendiary publications” to the South. Congress, saying it had no power to restrain the press, rejected his idea. Southerners asked Northern state officials to suppress abolitionist newspapers, but they did not comply.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_005">Michael Kent Curtis, <em class="emphasis">Free Speech, “The People’s Darling Privilege”: Struggles for Freedom of Expression in American History</em> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000), especially chaps. 6–8, quote at 189.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s02_p01">As the federal government’s power grew, so too did concerns about civil liberties. When the United States entered the First World War in 1917, the government jailed many radicals and opponents of the war. Persecution of dissent caused Progressive reformers to found the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) in 1920. Today, the ACLU pursues civil liberties for both powerless and powerful litigants across the political spectrum. While it is often deemed a liberal group, it has defended reactionary organizations, such as the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan, and has joined powerful lobbies in opposing campaign finance reform as a restriction of speech.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">In <a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch05#paletz_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Civil Rights"</a>, we discuss the Fourteenth Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1868, and how its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">due process clause</a><span class="glossdef">Section of the Fifth Amendment that prohibits the federal government from depriving individuals of “life, liberty or property without due process of law.”</span></span>, which bars <em class="emphasis">states</em> from depriving persons of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” is the basis of civil rights. The Fourteenth Amendment is crucial to civil liberties, too. The Bill of Rights restricts only the <em class="emphasis">national</em> government; the Fourteenth Amendment allows the Supreme Court to extend the Bill of Rights to the states.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p02">The Supreme Court exercised its new power gradually.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Interests, Institutions, and Civil Liberties</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p01">Many landmark Supreme Court civil-liberties cases were brought by unpopular litigants: members of radical organizations, publishers of anti-Semitic periodicals or of erotica, religious adherents to small sects, atheists and agnostics, or indigent criminal defendants. This pattern promotes a media frame suggesting that civil liberties grow through the Supreme Court’s staunch protection of the lowliest citizen’s rights.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p02">The finest example is the saga of Clarence Gideon in the book <em class="emphasis">Gideon’s Trumpet</em> by Anthony Lewis, then the Supreme Court reporter for the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>. The indigent Gideon, sentenced to prison, protested the state’s failure to provide him with a lawyer. Gideon made a series of handwritten appeals. The Court heard his case under a special procedure designed for paupers. Championed by altruistic civil-liberties experts, Gideon’s case established a constitutional right to have a lawyer provided, at the state’s expense, to all defendants accused of a felony.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_006">Anthony Lewis, <em class="emphasis">Gideon’s Trumpet</em> (New York: Vintage Books, 1964).</span> Similar storylines often appear in news accounts of Supreme Court cases. For example, television journalists personalize these stories by interviewing the person who brought the suit and telling the touching individual tale behind the case.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_007">Richard Davis, <em class="emphasis">Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the News Media</em> (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1994).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p03">This mass-media frame of the lone individual appealing to the Supreme Court is only part of the story. Powerful interests also benefit from civil-liberties protections. Consider, for example, freedom of expression: Fat-cat campaign contributors rely on freedom of speech to protect their right to spend as much money as they want to in elections. Advertisers say that commercial speech should be granted the same protection as political speech. Huge media conglomerates rely on freedom of the press to become unregulated and more profitable.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_008">Frederick Schauer, “The Political Incidence of the Free Speech Principle,” <em class="emphasis">University of Colorado Law Review</em> 64 (1993): 935–57.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p04">Many officials have to interpret the guarantees of civil liberties when making decisions and formulating policy. They sometimes have a broader awareness of civil liberties than do the courts. For example, the Supreme Court found in 1969 that two Arizona newspapers violated antitrust laws by sharing a physical plant while maintaining separate editorial operations. Congress and the president responded by enacting the Newspaper Preservation Act, saying that freedom of the press justified exempting such newspapers from antitrust laws.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p05">In this section we defined civil liberties as individual rights and freedoms that government may not infringe on. They are listed primarily in the Bill of Rights, the ten amendments added in 1791 by the founders to address fears about the new federal government’s potential to abuse power. Initially limited to the federal government, they now apply, though unevenly, to the states. What those liberties are and how far they extend are the focus of political conflict. They are shaped by the full range of people, processes, and institutions in American politics. Both unpopular minorities and powerful interests claim civil liberties protections to gain favorable outcomes.</p>

    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Freedom of Religion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The First Amendment addresses freedom of religion in two distinct clauses: the establishment clause and the free expression clause.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Establishment Clause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p01">Rejecting the British legacy of “established” churches, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">establishment clause</a><span class="glossdef">Section of the First Amendment that prohibits the government from recognizing an official religion.</span></span> bars Congress from giving any religion an official status. In Jefferson’s much-quoted line, the establishment clause erects a “wall of separation between church and state.” A public policy may advance religious objectives only if its aim and main effect have nothing to do with religion. Thus a law forcing stores to close on Sundays can be justified to require employers to give staff a day off but not to enforce a Sabbath.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_009"><em class="emphasis">Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>, 403 US 602 (1971).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p02">The separation of church and state has generated high-profile controversies. The drama surrounding such confrontations is often captured by the press. In the 1920s, John Thomas Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee law requiring that the Bible’s version of creation be taught in public schools. Scopes’s trial, portrayed in the stage play and film <em class="emphasis">Inherit the Wind</em>, was a precursor of later battles.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p04">Starting in the 1960s, the Supreme Court, in a series of rulings, prohibited nondenominational state-issued prayers in school, Bible readings, moments of silence intended for prayer, and student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies and football games. (The Court did refrain from invalidating the Pledge of Allegiance for containing the words “under God.”)<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_010">Respectively, <em class="emphasis">Engel v.

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Free Exercise Clause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p01">The First Amendment also says that Congress shall not prohibit the “free exercise” of religion. Individuals have the right to believe and practice their religions as they see fit. Government policies cannot target individuals’ religious practices or force actions that violate their religions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p02">This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free exercise clause</a><span class="glossdef">Section of the First Amendment that prohibits the government from barring individuals from freely practicing religion.</span></span> gained potency in 1943 when the Supreme Court ruled that Jehovah’s Witnesses could not be expelled from public schools for refusing to salute the American flag, an act contrary to their religion. More recently, the Supreme Court limited the clause’s reach when it ruled, in 1990, that American Indians had no right to disobey an Oregon law barring controlled substances in order to ingest peyote as part of a religious service. The Court held that laws hindering religious practices do not violate the First Amendment if they apply to all persons and do not openly refer to religion.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p03">The establishment clause tries to keep religion out of government; the free exercise clause tries to keep government out of religion. The two objectives are not always compatible. For example, President George W. Bush proposed to allow government to contract with “faith-based” organizations to administer social programs. Opponents argued that this would violate the establishment clause by endorsing religion; Bush responded that existing policy violated the free exercise clause by discriminating against religious organizations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Freedom of Speech</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">The Supreme Court has held that “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_011"><em class="emphasis">New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, 376 US 254 (1964).</span> Offensive speech is less detrimental than the “chilling effect” of individuals being silenced for fear of retribution. Nevertheless, freedom of speech is not absolute. Governments can regulate or restrict it under certain conditions.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Thoughts, Words, and Actions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01_p01">Thoughts are deemed beyond the scope of government regulation; actions are heavily regulated by government; words are somewhere in between. The distinctions between thoughts, words, and actions are not always clear. Two cases of protest against the Vietnam War show how lines are drawn.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_012"><em class="emphasis">United States v. O’Brien</em>, 391 US 367 (1968); and <em class="emphasis">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</em>, 393 US 503 (1969).</span> In one, a protester burned his draft card and was charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime to knowingly destroy draft cards. The Court upheld the law, saying that the law aimed to maintain draft records, not to stifle free expression. When two students wore black armbands to their high school to protest the war and were suspended for violating the dress code, the Court found the policy sought to suppress free expression and sided with the students.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">When Speech Can Be Regulated</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p01">The First Amendment does not protect speech that fails to contribute to the exchange of ideas that is crucial in a democracy—for instance, libel, obscenity, and “fighting words”—but such forms of speech are narrowly defined.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p02">The publication of defamatory information, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">libel</a><span class="glossdef">Defamatory publication unprotected by the First Amendment; to win a libel suit, public figures must demonstrate “actual malice” revealed by a “reckless disregard for the truth.”</span></span>, can be challenged in court. But officials and other public figures must demonstrate “actual malice” displayed by a “reckless disregard for the truth.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_013"><em class="emphasis">New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, 376 US 254 (1964).</span> Thus libel cases are hard to win. Nonetheless, some litigants sue to shame a media organization publicly or to force it to spend money defending itself in court.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p03">There is now a right to possess most obscene material in one’s home, but not to produce, sell, or ship it. Early in the twentieth century, obscenity laws had halted the circulation of works of art such as James Joyce’s now classic novel <em class="emphasis">Ulysses</em>. In 1957, the Supreme Court shrank the definition of obscenity from anything to do with sex to “material that deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest” and “utterly without redeeming social importance.” This decision forced the justices to hear dozens of cases in order to distinguish obscenity from protected speech. The results were almost comical. The often elderly justices viewed numerous pornographic films, the earthy Thurgood Marshall recounting the goings-on to his patrician, sight-impaired colleague John Harlan. At one point, Justice Potter Stewart exasperatedly wrote in one opinion, “I know it when I see it.” Finally, in 1973, the Court established three rules that must be met for material to be obscene: it appeals to a prurient interest by the standards of the local community; it depicts specified sexual conduct in a patently offensive way; and it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_014">The key cases here are <em class="emphasis">Roth v. United States</em>, 354 US 476 (1957); <em class="emphasis">Stanley v. Georgia</em>, 394 US 557 (1969); and <em class="emphasis">Miller v. California</em>, 413 US 15 (1973).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p04">In the 1920s, the Supreme Court allowed government to bar <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fighting words</a><span class="glossdef">Speech, not protected by the First Amendment, that provokes people to immediate attack or acts of violence.</span></span> as long as there was a “clear and present danger” of provoking an immediate attack or acts of violence. In Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s terms, freedom of speech does not extend to the right to falsely yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater. Such a rule allowed for suppression of radical voices. As late as 1951, the Court upheld a federal law banning advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government. But the Court, in 1969, held that speech favoring illegal action is protected unless violence is both intended and likely.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_015">Respectively, <em class="emphasis">Schenck v. United States</em>, 249 US 47 (1919); <em class="emphasis">Dennis v. United States</em>, 341 US 494 (1951); and <em class="emphasis">Brandenburg v. Ohio</em>, 395 US 444 (1969).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p05">Even when the government cannot bar speech, it can direct its time, place, and manner. But policies may not target particular content and must provide alternative ways to express oneself. If public universities and colleges cannot ban political speeches, they may restrict them to certain parts of campus such as “Free Speech Alleys.”</p>

Four students, including two passersby, died. A photographer snapped fifteen-year-old runaway Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling and screaming over Jeffrey Miller’s dead body. Another showed National Guardsmen, impersonal under gas masks, aiming rifles at defenseless students. Such images conjure up brutal, deliberate repression of rights of protest.

Protests were not always peaceful. In Kent, students smashed store windows on May 1, and Kent State’s ROTC building was burned down on May 2. Ohio’s governor mobilized the National Guard to defend the campus. On May 4, the Guard, badly outnumbered, sought to stop the rally. Other photos from May 4 show students taunting the Guard, fogs of tear gas, and volleys of empty tear-gas canisters and rocks thrown at soldiers. The picture of soldiers aiming their rifles may have been an early attempt to subdue the protest without shooting. The immediate response to the shootings did not blame the Guard. Nixon’s reaction was widely reprinted: “This should remind us all once again that when dissent turns to violence it invites tragedy.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_023">Quoted in Sue Schuurman, “Kent State Killings Shock Nation: 28 Years Ago This Week,” <em class="emphasis">Weekly Alibi</em>, May 11, 1998, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-11-98/alibi_skeleton.html">http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-11-98/alibi_skeleton.html</a>.</span> Polls showed most of the public blamed students for the deaths and backed the Guard’s actions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_024">See the Gallup poll from <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, May 25, 1970, 30, cited in James J.

One reason is its emotional resonance: it resembles a Pietà sculpture of Mary grieving over the body of Jesus. Also, American politics after the invasion of Cambodia turned from engaging in to ending the Vietnam War—in part as a response to unrest that racked the country. And President Nixon’s law-and-order rhetoric lost support as revelations of illegal misdeeds surfaced in the Watergate scandal. By the fall of 1973, a majority in a Harris poll saw the shootings as “unjustified and repressive.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_025"><em class="emphasis">New York Post</em>, October 3, 1973, as reported in J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Right to Keep and Bear Arms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">The Second Amendment reads, “A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Is this a right of self-defense that is akin to the protection of one’s dwelling guaranteed by other amendments?<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_026">Joyce Lee Malcolm, <em class="emphasis">To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994).</span> Or is it simply a basis for states to build militias, balancing off the standing army of the national government—in which case the gradual replacement of volunteer state militias by the National Guard rendered the Second Amendment obsolete?<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_027">H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel, <em class="emphasis">The Militia and the Right to Arms, Or, How the Second Amendment Fell Silent</em> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Most crime rates in the United States are similar to those of countries such as Canada or Australia. But the United States has a far higher rate of violent crime, in part because of the greater availability of firearms. A large majority of the public supports restrictions on the sale of firearms, but few policies have been enacted to do so. Although opponents of gun control are outnumbered, they are more likely than supporters to vote on this issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Policy debate on gun control usually occurs only after a dramatic, heavily covered news event like an assassination or a massacre at a school. One political scientist described the result as “furious politics, marginal policy.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_028">Robert J. Spitzer, <em class="emphasis">The Politics of Gun Control</em> (Chatham, NJ: Chatham House, 1995), 168.</span> For example, after the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in 1968, Congress debated President Lyndon Johnson’s proposal for a federal system of firearm registration and licensing of gun owners but passed only limited, ineffective legislation. In 1994, dramatic fights over banning assault weapons and mandating a waiting period for gun purchases produced a law with huge loopholes when it failed to cover gun shows.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p04">The “right to keep and bear arms” has been debated by the public and politicians more than by courts. But in June 2008, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5–4, ruled that individuals have the right to bear arms. This decision, an interpretation of the Second Amendment, struck down the District of Columbia’s thirty-two-year-old law banning the possession of handguns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_029"><em class="emphasis">District of Columbia v. Heller</em>, 554 US 570 (2008).</span> In June 2010, the Court, again by a vote of 5–4, applied the ruling to cities and states by overturning Chicago’s ban on handguns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_030"><em class="emphasis">McDonald v. Chicago</em>, 561 US ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (2010).</span> The Court has not prohibited all legislation and limitation of guns, but such governmental actions would likely conflict with the Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Searches and Seizures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">The Fourth Amendment prevents the government from conducting “unreasonable searches and seizures.” A reasonable search is conducted with a warrant issued by a judge and based on probable cause. What is “unreasonable” varies with how much privacy people can expect when they are being searched. Cars are less private than houses, so rules for searches of cars are less stringent. And government agencies can state reasons to compel persons not suspected of a crime to submit to searches and seizures. The goal of preventing airplanes from being hijacked authorizes mandatory searches of persons and their property before boarding aircraft and allows the confiscation of objects deemed dangerous.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Electronic Searches</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p01">New technologies complicate searches and seizures. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment did not simply restrict physical entry: it “protects people, not places.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_031"><em class="emphasis">Olmstead v. United States</em>, 277 US 438 (1928) and <em class="emphasis">Katz v. United States</em>, 389 US 347 (1967).</span> The pivotal test is whether a person has “a legitimate expectation of privacy” regardless of the technological means used to search. Thus the Court has held that the use of heat-sensing devices able to find intensive marijuana farms inside closets requires a search warrant as much as would a physical entry to one’s house.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_032"><em class="emphasis">Kyllo v. US</em>, 533 US 27 (2001).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p02">New technologies can also intrude into formerly private domains hitherto free from the potentially prying eye of government. For example, e-mail passes through many portals en route to delivery, each of which may be available for search without the sender’s or receiver’s knowledge. E-mail and web searches are still available in shadowy form even after the hard drive has seemingly been erased, and they can be searched for key words or other patterns efficiently. Police and prosecutors now have new weapons at their disposal in tracking down possible criminal activity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p03">The massive computerization of information tempts the government even more. In May 2004, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on data mining. It documented 52 federal agencies conducting 122 projects to collect, analyze, and use identifiable information on US persons for national security and law enforcement purposes. These numbers, which omit classified projects, are probably low-ball estimates.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Collectively, the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Amendments set forth procedural guarantees known as “rights of the accused,” which exist through the criminal process from accusation to trial to conviction.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p01">The central right of the accused is the presumption that anyone charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty in court. This rule can be hard to preserve when an accused individual has been subjected to massive unfavorable media attention prior to or during a trial. For example, the police have perfected a technique known as the “perp walk” (for “perpetrator”), allowing television cameras to film the accused—often handcuffed and in prison garb—escorted by police. Such images, repeated over and over again in news broadcasts, can lead viewers to presume guilt rather than innocence.</p>

Claiming this right not to incriminate oneself is popularly called “taking the fifth.” Witnesses may be compelled to testify only if given immunity from prosecution.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_035"><em class="emphasis">Quinn v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p02">Such restrictions frustrate law enforcement officers, who find confessions among the best means to obtain a guilty verdict.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p03">The right against self-incrimination originally meant only that individuals could not be forced to testify against themselves during their trials. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court threw out convictions for which evidence had been gained by torture or coercion and slowly expanded the right to cover all discussions with all law enforcement officials.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p04">By 1966, the Court was weary of issuing case-by-case decisions about whether the police had gone too far in questioning suspects. In <em class="emphasis">Miranda v. Arizona</em> (384 US 436), the justices, having reviewed numerous police manuals, concluded that police often tried to create an atmosphere designed to intimidate or manipulate the accused into confessing. The justices ruled that law enforcement officials must “demonstrate the use of procedural safeguards” by ensuring that the accused is “adequately and effectively apprised of his rights.” The Miranda decision required a warning to be read to suspects prior to interrogation—this warning is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Miranda rights</a><span class="glossdef">List of rights that the police must tell suspects if their confessions are to be admitted as evidence in court.</span></span>—without which their statements could not be admitted as evidence in court. Suspects must be notified of the following: that they have the right to remain silent, that whatever they say can be used against them in court, that they have the right to be represented by a lawyer before and during questioning, that they have the right to have a lawyer provided by the court if they cannot afford one, and that they have the right to terminate questioning at any time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p06">But are they effective? Police officers view the reading of these rights as a mere technicality. They can get information by appealing to a suspect’s desire to tell his or her story and by acting as if they are on the suspect’s side. Even after suspects invoke Miranda rights, officers can try to change their minds or elicit what they term off-the-record information. Eighty percent of suspects voluntarily waive their rights; many confess.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_036">Welsh S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p01">Over time, Supreme Court decisions have outlined processes for a suspect to be tried in court. The most important are the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Individuals cannot be subject to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double jeopardy</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of putting someone on trial a second time for a crime after their acquittal; prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.</span></span>; in other words, they cannot be tried again for a crime after being acquitted of it in an earlier trial. This restriction does not prevent someone acquitted in a criminal case from being sued in a civil case: actor-athlete O. J. Simpson, found not guilty of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, was found in civil court to be responsible and financially liable for their deaths.</li>
                <li>Suspects must know and understand the charges and evidence against them; therefore, cases against those “incompetent to stand trial” for reasons of illness or insanity must be dismissed, and juvenile suspects cannot be tried as adults.</li>
                <li>The trial must be speedy, so that someone not yet proven guilty is not punished by lengthy incarceration before trial.</li>
                <li>Defendants for serious crimes (punishable by more than six months in prison or a $500 fine) and those in federal civil cases have a right to a trial by an “impartial jury” of their peers.</li>
                <li>Defendants have a right to face and confront witnesses against them.</li>
                <li>The accused has a right to a defense attorney. At first, this meant only that accused persons could pay for lawyers to represent them. But the 1932 case of seven young African American men sentenced in Scottsboro, Alabama, to die on a charge of raping two white women (a charge later found to be trumped-up) persuaded the Supreme Court otherwise. The justices ruled that these defendants—poor, illiterate, and charged with a capital offense—had to be represented by a public defender, a defense attorney employed and paid by the state.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p02">This ruling gradually extended to all defendants in federal courts, then to felony defendants in state courts, and eventually to anyone facing any jail time.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_037"><em class="emphasis">Johnson v.

Cronic</em>, 466 US 648 (1984) and <em class="emphasis">Strickland v. Washington</em>, 466 US 668 (1984).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s03_p03">Moreover, most charges are resolved prior to trial when a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p01">Civil liberties are often impaired during international crises. Witness the “war on terrorism,” which is no exception. While the revelations in April 2004 of abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison may be a matter more for international law than civil liberties, other rights of the accused were also in question after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p02">In October 2001, Congress enacted the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/highlights.htm">USA Patriot Act</a>. Among other things, it authorized the attorney general to detain indefinitely a noncitizen when there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that the person is a threat to national security. Attorney General John Ashcroft praised these policies, correctly observing, “It is difficult for a person in jail or under detention to murder innocent people or to aid or abet in terrorism.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_039">Quoted in Matthew Purdy, “Bush’s New Rules to Fight Terror Transform the Legal Landscape,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 25, 2001, B4.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p03">The Bush administration used these powers vigorously. Hundreds of resident aliens were detained without explanation in the fall of 2001, many in solitary confinement. When the Taliban government was overthrown in Afghanistan in late 2001, American forces captured some ten thousand soldiers and other Afghanis. Many of them were named “enemy combatants” (not “prisoners of war,” who would have greater protection under international law). Shackled and hooded, they were shipped to a military prison at the base at Guantánamo Bay. Some were subjected to abusive interrogation. The base was located on land the United States had leased from Cuba in perpetuity, and thus, according to the Bush administration, it was outside the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_040">For a detailed history of abuses in the war on terror, see Jane Mayer, <em class="emphasis">The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals</em> (New York: Doubleday, 2008); and for a critique of the trade-off between liberty and security see David Cole and Jules Lobel, <em class="emphasis">Less Safe, Less Free: Why America Is Losing the War on Terror</em> (New York: New Press, 2007).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p04">Many rights of the accused were directly challenged by these policies: the right to know charges against oneself, the right to counsel, the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to a jury of one’s peers, the right to confront adverse witnesses, and the ability to appeal decisions to a higher court.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p05">In 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the president’s power as commander in chief to name persons as enemy combatants, to hold them indefinitely under Congress’s authorization of military force, and to fashion trial proceedings with less stringent standards of evidence. But that due process required that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the detention’s basis before a neutral decision maker. The Court also ruled that because the United States controlled Guantánamo, all detainees there had the habeas corpus right to go to federal court to challenge their detention.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_041"><em class="emphasis">Hamdi v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s04_p06">In response, the Bush administration began keeping detainees in a camp in Bagram, Afghanistan, in the theater of war, where judges could not go. And Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, removing the federal courts’ jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus applications from detainees designated as enemy combatants. Then, in 2008, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5–4, declared the Military Commissions Act unconstitutional, thereby giving back to enemy combatants their habeas corpus rights.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_042"><em class="emphasis">Boumediene et al. v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_s01_p01">Through the 1970s, prisoners were rarely expected to serve out their full sentences. Parole or “time off for good behavior” gave incentives to cooperate and acquire skills needed to reenter society. But media stories about crimes committed by paroled ex-cons impelled “truth-in-sentencing” laws—mandatory minimums or fixed sentences for given crimes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_s01_p02">States began adopting “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” laws.

In 1972, the Supreme Court threw out all state laws imposing the death penalty as a violation of due process being arbitrarily applied from one case to the next. In 1976, the Court allowed states to impose capital punishment as long as it is decided on by a jury following a strict process, weighing mitigating and aggravating circumstances to decide if death is the most appropriate punishment.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_048"><em class="emphasis">Furman v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_s02_p02">The main objection to the death penalty today is that it cannot be applied dependably enough to meet the Bill of Rights’ standards for due process.

This focus on the exoneration of the wrongfully convicted, sometimes by dramatic revelations of exculpatory DNA evidence, shifts the media’s frame away from the victims of crime to the victims of prosecution, and may thereby shift public opinion. But for the daytime talk show, the victims are survivors of violent crime who rely on the justice system to give them what Winfrey called “closure.” The future of capital punishment may depend on which frame wins.</p>

The justices ruled in 2005 against a homeowner who contested the city’s plan to replace her economically depressed neighborhood with an office park, hotel, and conference center.

Members of Congress sought but failed to obtain the two-thirds majorities necessary for a constitutional amendment declaring that life begins with conception, thereby recognizing the fetus as a “person” able to receive the protection of the Bill of Rights. President Reagan, elected in 1980, also pushed to reverse <em class="emphasis">Roe</em>. States tried to test <em class="emphasis">Roe</em>’s boundaries.

In 1992, the justices considered a Pennsylvania law that required a married woman’s husband to be notified before she could have an abortion and a twenty-four-hour waiting period for a woman to be provided with information about risks and consequences of abortion. But Justice Anthony Kennedy, allying with Souter and Sandra Day O’Connor (a Reagan appointee), jointly wrote an opinion. They declined to overturn <em class="emphasis">Roe</em>’s central tenet that a woman had a right to an abortion prior to the ability of the fetus to live outside the womb. But they scrapped the trimester scheme of <em class="emphasis">Roe</em> and put in a new (if less clear) test of whether a law imposes an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to an abortion. The decision supported most of the restrictions Pennsylvania had placed on abortion. It fit public opinion that was against reversing <em class="emphasis">Roe v.

Giving it the unsettling term “partial-birth abortion” and recounting dramatic examples of its use late in a pregnancy, the pro-life side refocused the attention of the media on the fetus and away from the pro-choice emphasis on a woman’s right to decide (with her physician) on abortion without government interference.</p>

The Supreme Court has interpreted the Second Amendment as allowing people to bear arms. Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures is complicated by the development of new technologies. Rights of the accused include the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty, protection against self-incrimination, the Miranda rights, and trial processes. Some policies initiated by the government’s war on terror have challenged these rights. The rights of convicted criminals apply to punishment, prison terms, and the death penalty. Property rights can conflict with the government’s power of eminent domain. Abortion is subject to Supreme Court decisions and political conflict.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_p02">“Liberty” is a word with special resonance in the United States. It is hailed in the Pledge of Allegiance. It is featured in the lyrics of patriotic songs. It is emblazoned on coins. The Liberty Bell and the Statue of Liberty are among the most central symbols of the promise of the United States. News and entertainment often pay homage to the value of civil liberties. Indeed, the media, like the American people as a whole, are strongly committed in principle to civil liberties, especially when presented as elements of the hallowed Bill of Rights. Yet, the media often slight, even undermine, specific civil liberties.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Interactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p01">Media personnel find civil liberties to be a vital topic because they hold fast to freedom of expression as a crucial protection to perform their jobs. Also, the frame of the virtuous individual standing up for beloved principles against the government is easily presentable as a defense of civil liberties.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p02">The rights of the accused are the kernel of many a media story. For instance, dramas from the vantage point of a person wrongly accused by officials of a crime are perennial favorites in films and television. The television drama <em class="emphasis">Perry Mason</em> compiled 271 episodes from 1957 to 1966, and they are endlessly rerun. Each episode is similar: the brilliant lawyer Perry Mason defends his client in court against a rush to judgment by the district attorney and police and, in a climactic cross-examination, unveils the true guilty party.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p03">Nowadays, the media feature crime control. Witness the television show <em class="emphasis">Law and Order</em> and its various spin-offs: these shows are presented from the perspectives of police and prosecutors, not civil liberties. Or consider crime in the news: its good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic makes it easy to tell and enables the news to crank out accounts of crime on a day-in-day-out (or hour-in-hour-out) basis. These stories are reported almost entirely from sources in police stations and courts. Crime-beat reporters call up police spokespersons every day and ask, “What have you got?” Police officers are happy to direct reporters to newsworthy events and quick, reliable information. By one estimate, newspapers report nine crime stories a day; local television news includes four a day. Because reporters rely so heavily on police for information, police misconduct, including violations of civil liberties, usually get scant attention.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_059">See the ethnographic research of Steven M. Chermak in his book <em class="emphasis">Victims in the News: Crime and the American News Media</em> (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1995), especially chap. 2.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p04">Similarly, war or other national security crises rarely invite critical media coverage, particularly in the early phases when the media act within a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sphere of consensus</a><span class="glossdef">General agreement about the causes of and how to respond to a crisis.</span></span>: a general agreement about the causes of and how to respond to a crisis. The media, already suspected by many of left-leaning bias, are sensitive to accusations of being unpatriotic and are attracted to the saga of the United States unified against its demonized enemies. As a result, the government’s voice is usually enhanced, and dissenters’ voices are muffled, making it easier for the government to advance restrictions on civil liberties in the name of national security.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p05">In the first months after 9/11 officials and reporters began to ask if the failure to predict the terrorist attacks was occasioned by legal restrictions on cooperation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These laws had been set in place to protect civil liberties and discourage the government from spying on its own citizens. Such concerns were eclipsed when the news media referred to legislation to lift those restrictions as “laws to make it easier for the FBI to gather information.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p06">The media are may be distracted away from civil liberties—and downplay their importance—for one other reason. Asserting civil liberties is often the way unpopular minorities struggle against being repressed or silenced in a majority-rule political system. But such outsiders have trouble getting their concerns into the news on their own terms, particularly if they are opposed to the government. They often have no choice except to make theatrical efforts to attract the news media’s appetite for dramatic conflict, such as demonstrating against or disrupting official events. This makes it hard for them to use the media to claim the civil liberty protections that are vital to their survival.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Consequences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_p01">The mass media’s choice of frames between law and order and civil liberties has powerful consequences. In one study, people were presented with different frames for a Ku Klux Klan march. When the news story framed the event as a threat to law and order, people gave high priority to the importance of order and low support for the application of civil liberties, the reverse of those who viewed a news story framing the march as an instance of freedom of expression.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_060">Thomas E. Nelson, Rosalee A. Clawson, and Zoe M. Oxley, “Media Framing of a Civil Liberties Conflict and Its Effect on Tolerance,” <em class="emphasis">American Political Science Review</em> 91 (1997): 567–83; also George E. Marcus, John L. Sullivan, Elizabeth Theiss-Morse, and Sandra L. Wood, <em class="emphasis">With Malice toward Some: How People Make Civil Liberties Judgments</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Such ambivalence is not unique to the mass media. All the institutions, processes, and participants in American politics display a strong commitment to civil liberties alongside a willingness to submerge that commitment when other commitments (especially the maintenance of law and order) become more prominent—unless the issue is reframed, notably through media presentations, as one of civil liberties.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_p03">That said, the primary advocates and the main beneficiaries of civil liberties are not always—in fact, not often—the downtrodden and the underdog. As we have seen, powerful political forces use the leverage of civil liberties to win battles and gain yet more power. The freedoms of the Bill of Rights are not simply dusty statements of long-held principle. Nor are they simply obligations for government to protect the vulnerable. Instead, the words of the Bill of Rights are <em class="emphasis">tools</em> used in politics by all—and all kinds of—political players.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_p04">In this section we saw that the media are ambivalent about civil liberties, much like the American public and the participants in American government, as their focus on civil liberties is in tension with at least equally strong concerns about crime and the need for law and order. American politics, powerfully buttressed by the media, is thus equivocal toward civil liberties, valued in principle but often submerged by other, seemingly more pressing, concerns.</p>
