    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p01">On July 30, 2010, Congressman Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn, New York, made an impassioned plea on the House floor blasting Republican members who were blocking a bill allocating $7 billion to monitor the health of first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. He begged members to vote their conscience and to do what is right rather than to adhere to party lines. He refused to yield the floor when he was called out of order, shouting and gesticulating to emphasize his point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p02">Weiner’s angry and emotional two-minute outburst might well have gone the way of most congressional speechmaking, and been ignored by the press and the public. Few speeches, especially those made by little-known congressmen, receive media coverage other than on the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), which routinely reports congressional proceedings. Instead, videos of Weiner’s remarks were posted on YouTube and other websites and quickly went viral. Within forty-eight hours, the YouTube video had been viewed over half a million times. The speech caught the attention of news producers and received coverage on morning and evening national network newscasts, cable news, radio, newspapers, and online publications. The YouTube video sparked numerous remixes, including one where Weiner is featured singing his rant to a dance tune.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p03">Weiner’s speech brings to light a number of points about Congress and the media. Congress receives significantly less media attention than the president. Yet members rely on the media to publicize their actions, rally support for their positions, and run for reelection. It takes extraordinary efforts and publicity-seeking strategies for even prominent members to get press attention. In the current era, these strategies include making use of digital media, such as Twitter feeds and YouTube videos, to drive media coverage. Political leaders must be responsible in their use of digital media, as Weiner learned the hard way. In May 2011, the media reported that Weiner had sent inappropriate photos of himself via Twitter to women who were not his wife. The resulting scandal forced his resignation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p04">The media’s relationship with Congress maintains the distinction between the national institution of Congress and its locally elected members. Congress as an institution commands national media attention, while members of Congress are covered extensively in their local press.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_001">Wendy J. Schiller, <em class="emphasis">Partners and Rivals</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000).</span> The fact that Weiner’s speech dealing with an issue of particular concern to his constituents in New York gained national media attention was atypical. It was made possible because his rant conformed to the dramatic expectations of modern-day political media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p05">Congress is a national institution composed of locally elected politicians who represent distinct constituencies. Members rely on the support of voters in their home districts to keep their job in Congress. Members of Congress must work together to consider policy issues and make laws. Yet getting one hundred senators and 435 members of the House of Representatives to work collectively is a gargantuan task. The cumbersome legislative procedure outlined by the Constitution favors inaction. Members seeking to represent the interests of people back home can come into conflict with prevailing sentiments in Washington, creating obstacles to lawmaking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p06">The institution of Congress is slow to change. A large body with an intricate organizational structure, Congress operates under a complex system of rules and traditions (e.g., the filibuster in the Senate), some of which are byzantine. Congress adapts to innovations, including developments in communications media (e.g., television and the Internet), at a snail’s pace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s00_p07">This chapter begins with discussions of the powers of Congress and the institution’s bicameral structure. It examines the party and leadership organizations as well as committees and their work. This chapter details the legislative process—how a bill becomes law—as well as the process of establishing the nation’s budget. It also covers the characteristics of members of Congress, their job description, and their staffs. Finally, Congress’s interactions with the media in the information age are investigated. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/index.php">Center on Congress</a> at Indiana University is a good source of information about Congress, including its relationship with the media.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s01_p02">The institution of Congress is responsible for carrying out the legislative duties of the federal government. The powers of Congress are enumerated in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Article I of the Constitution</a><span class="glossdef">The article that enumerates the powers of Congress.</span></span>. The founders established Congress in Article I, Section 1, which states, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” By instituting Congress in the first article of the Constitution the founders asserted their belief that the legislative branch should be the chief policymaking body. They preferred a government with power vested in the legislature, which they considered most representative of the people, rather than one where the executive was preeminent. They associated the executive branch with the British monarchy, which they had fought against in the Revolutionary War, so they relegated the presidency to the second article of the Constitution. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 51, “In a republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_002">Clinton Rossiter, ed., “Federalist 51,” in <em class="emphasis">The Federalist</em>, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay (New York: Mentor, 1961), 322.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Constitutional Powers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Congress was granted tremendous political power by the founders. These powers are listed primarily in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which states that Congress has broad discretion to “provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” To achieve this end, Congress has the authority to make and implement laws.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p02">The Constitution lists a number of specific powers entrusted to Congress. These include responsibility for the nation’s budget and commerce, such as the power to lay and collect taxes, to pay the debts, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, to coin money, and to establish post offices. Congress is assigned the power to declare war and to raise an army and navy. Congress has the right to propose amendments to the Constitution and to create new states.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p04">Political parties are central to the organizational structure of Congress. Parties provide a measure of discipline that helps the House and Senate to function more efficiently. Members who switch parties often lose the benefits of seniority, such as committee chair positions, and face an uncertain future when they seek reelection.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Leadership Criteria</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p01">House members consider a number of factors when choosing leaders. A member’s personal reputation, interactions with other members, legislative skills, expertise, experience, length of service, and knowledge of the institution are taken into account. Members tend to choose leaders who are in the ideological mainstream of their party and represent diverse regions of the country. The positions that a member has held in Congress, such as service on important committees, are evaluated. Fundraising ability, media prowess, and communications skills are increasingly important criteria for leadership. The ability to forge winning coalitions and the connections that a member has to leaders in the Senate or the executive branch are factored into the decision.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_018">Robert L. Peabody, <em class="emphasis">Leadership in Congress</em> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1976).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p02">Holding a congressional leadership position is challenging, especially as most members think of themselves as leaders rather than followers. Revolts can occur when members feel leaders are wielding too much power or promoting personal agendas at the expense of institutional goals. At times, a leader’s style or personality may rub members the wrong way and contribute to their being ousted from office.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_019">Joseph Cooper and David W. Brady, “Institutional Context and Leadership Style: The House from Cannon to Rayburn,” <em class="emphasis">American Political Science Review</em> 75, no. 2 (June 1981): 411–25.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Speaker of the House</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Speaker of the House</a><span class="glossdef">The top-ranking member and presiding officer of the House of Representatives.</span></span> is at the top of the leadership hierarchy. The Speaker is second in succession to the presidency and is the only officer of the House mentioned specifically in the Constitution. The Speaker’s official duties include referring bills to committees, appointing members to select and conference committees, counting and announcing all votes on legislation, and signing all bills passed by the House. He rarely participates in floor debates or votes on bills. The Speaker also is the leader of his or her political party in the House. In this capacity, the Speaker oversees the party’s committee assignments, sets the agenda of activities in the House, and bestows rewards on faithful party members, such as committee leadership positions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_020">Thomas P. Carr, “Party Leaders in the House: Election, Duties, and Responsibilities,” <em class="emphasis">CRS Report for Congress</em>, October 5, 2001, order code RS20881.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p02">In addition to these formal responsibilities, the Speaker has significant power to control the legislative agenda in the House. The Rules Committee, through which all bills must pass, functions as an arm of the Speaker. The Speaker appoints members of the Rules Committee who can be relied on to do his or her bidding. He or she exercises control over which bills make it to the floor for consideration and the procedures that will be followed during debate. Special rules, such as setting limits on amendments or establishing complex time allocations for debate, can influence the contents of a bill and help or hinder its passage.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_021">Nicol C. Rae and Colton C. Campbell, eds. <em class="emphasis">New Majority or Old Minority?</em> (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p03">Speakers’ personal styles have influenced the evolution of the position. Speaker Joe Cannon (R-IL) became the most powerful Speaker of the House by using strong-arm tactics to control members of both parties. “Czar” Cannon’s style so angered his colleagues that he was forced to step down as chairman of the Rules Committee during the St. Patrick’s Day Revolt of 1910, which stripped him of his ability to control appointments and legislation. The position lost prestige and power until Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-TX) took office in 1940. Rayburn was able to use his popularity and political acumen to reestablish the Speakership as a powerful position.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_022">Ronald M. Peters, Jr., <em class="emphasis">The American Speakership</em> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p04">A Speaker’s personal style can influence the amount of media coverage the position commands. The Speaker can become the public face of the House by appearing frequently in the press. A charismatic speaker can rival the president in grabbing media attention and setting the nation’s issue agenda. On April 7, 1995, Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) made an unprecedented prime-time television “State of the Congress” address on CBS indicating that the House has passed the Contract With America, a plan that proposed extensive changes to the social welfare system and tax policy. Despite the fact that the Contract with America died in the Senate, Gingrich became a “multimedia Whirling Dervish of books, writings, lectures, tapes, and television, spewing out ideas.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_023">Dan Balz and Ronald Brownstein, <em class="emphasis">Storming the Gates</em> (Boston: Little Brown, 1996), 143.</span> He was a constant presence on the television and radio talk show circuit, which kept attention focused on his party’s issue platform. This strategy worked at the outset, as the Republicans were able to push through some of their proposals. Gingrich’s aggressive personal style and media blitz eventually backfired by alienating members of both parties. This experience illustrates that the media can have a boomerang effect—publicity can make a political leader and just as quickly can bring him down.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p05">In contrast, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), who took office in 1999, exhibited an accommodating leadership style and was considered a “nice guy” by most members. He worked behind the scenes to build coalitions and achieve his policy initiatives. After the election of President George W. Bush, Hastert coordinated a communications strategy with the executive branch to promote a Republican policy agenda. He shared the media spotlight, which other members appreciated. His cooperative approach was effective in getting important budget legislation passed.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_024">Roger H. Davidson and Walter J.

Syndicated <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> columnist Maureen Dowd wrote a piece on November 6, 2006, titled “Squeaker of the House.” Dowd alleged that Pelosi’s first act after becoming Speaker was to “throw like a girl” and that she was “making her first move based on relationships and past slights rather than strategy.” “Squeaker of the House” became a moniker that stuck with Pelosi throughout her tenure as Speaker and was the subject of a YouTube parody. Pelosi was replaced by Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) when the Republicans took control of the House following the 2010 midterm elections.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p01">Members of Congress from the Republican and Democratic parties elect whips who are responsible for encouraging party loyalty and discipline in the House. Aided by extensive networks of deputies and assistants, whips make sure that the lines of communication between leaders and members remain open. In 2002, whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) greatly expanded his organization to include forty senior whips and thirty assistant whips to enforce a “strategy of inclusion,” which gives more members the opportunity to work closely with party leaders and become vested in party decisions. This strategy made more party leaders with expertise available to the press in the hopes of increasing coverage of the Democratic Party’s positions. Whips keep track of members’ voting intentions on key bills and try persuade wayward members to toe the party line.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_027">Roger H. Davidson and Walter J.

At the top of the leadership hierarchy is the Speaker of the House, who is the body’s presiding officer. Majority and minority leaders help set their party’s agenda on issues.

In 1955, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency staged three days of hearings in New York City as part of its investigation into allegations brought by Senator Estes Kefauver (D-TN), a subcommittee member, that violent comic books could turn children into criminals. The press-friendly hearings featured controversial speakers and slides of comic strips depicting a machine gun–toting woman character named “Frisco Mary” blowing away law enforcement officials without remorse that were circulated widely in the media. Kefauver anticipated that the press generated by these hearings would help him gain publicity for a bid to get on the 1956 Democratic presidential ticket. He lost the presidential nomination battle but ended up the vice presidential candidate for the losing side.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_029">Amy Kiste Nyberg, <em class="emphasis">Seal of Approval</em> (Oxford: University of Mississippi Press, 1998).</span></p>

The first of these was the 1913 “Pujo hearings,” in which Rep. Arsene Pujo (D-LA) headed a probe of Wall Street financiers. High-profile investigations in the 1920s included an inquiry into the mismanagement of the Teapot Dome oil reserves. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Congress conducted an investigation of the stock market, targeting Wall Street once again. Newspapers were willing to devote much front-page ink to these hearings, as reports on the hearings increased newspaper readership.

People in government, the labor movement, and the motion picture industry were accused of being communists. Especially sensational were hearings where Hollywood actors, directors, and writers were called before the HUAC. It was not uncommon for people in Hollywood to have joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression of the 1930s, although many were inactive at the time of the hearings. HUAC alleged that film “was the principle medium through which Communists have sought to inject their propaganda.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_035">Phillip L.

The “<strong class="emphasis bold">Hollywood Ten</strong>,” a group of nine screenwriters, including Ring Lardner, Jr. and Dalton Trumbo, and director Edward Dmytryk, were paraded before the committee. Members of Congress shouted to the witnesses, “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” They were commanded to provide the names of people they knew to be Communists or face incarceration. Some of the Hollywood Ten responded aggressively to the committee, not answering questions and making statements asserting their First Amendment right to free expression. Blinding flashbulbs provided a constant backdrop to the hearings, as photographers documented images of dramatic face-offs between committee members and the witnesses. Images of the hearings were disseminated widely in front-page photos in newspapers and magazines and on television.</p>

Major bills focusing on divisive issues, such as budgetary proposals, health care, and national security, will prompt lengthy debate and amendment proposals before coming to a vote. A bill dies if either chamber fails to pass it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Budget Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p01">One of the most arduous tasks faced by Congress is passing legislation authorizing the nation’s annual budget. House and Senate members, their staffs, and congressional committees in conjunction with the president and the executive branch are responsible for preparing the budget. The president submits a detailed budget proposal to Congress, which serves as a starting point. The House and Senate Budget Committees hold hearings on the budget to get advice about how funds should be spent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p02">The nonpartisan <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Congressional Budget Office</a><span class="glossdef">Provides expert budgetary advice to Congress.</span></span> (CBO) with a staff of over 230 economists and policy analysts, provides expert budgetary advice to Congress. It reviews the president’s budget plan, projects the actual costs of budget items, and develops options for changes in taxing and spending. CBO staffers prepare detailed reports on the budget and testify before Congress.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_055">“CBO’s Role in the Budget Office” (Washington, DC: Congressional Budget Office, 2005), accessed February 16, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/visitorsgallery/budgetprocess.shtml">http://www.cbo.gov/visitorsgallery/budgetprocess.shtml</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p03">A two-step authorization and appropriations process is required to establish and fund specific programs within the guidelines set by the annual budget. Congress must first pass laws authorizing or recommending that federal programs receive funding at a particular level. The appropriations process, where funds are actually allocated to programs for spending, is the second step. The House Appropriations Committee initiates all bills to fund programs, and its counterpart in the Senate must approve funding bills. The budget resolution that ultimately passes the House and Senate Budget Committees is usually markedly different from the president’s budget proposal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p04">The budget process rarely goes smoothly. The process can stall, as was the case in 2011 when the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget threatened to result in a government shutdown. Media coverage highlighting partisan bickering over what to fund and what to cut from the budget added to the drama surrounding the budget process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s01_p01">The vast majority of members of Congress are white males from middle- to upper-income groups. A majority are baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. The 111th Congress—which coincided with the administration of President Barack Obama, one of the nation’s youngest presidents, who took office at age forty-seven—was the oldest in history. In the 112th Congress, the average age of House members is fifty-seven and the average of senators is sixty-two. Most have a college education, and many have advanced degrees.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_061">Jennifer E.

Ninety-one of the seats in the 112th Congress, or 16 percent, were held by women. These included seventy-four women in the House and seventeen in the Senate. A record number of forty-four African Americans served in the House, but there were none in the Senate. There were twenty-eight Hispanics in Congress—twenty-six in the House and two in the Senate. Thirteen Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and a single Native American were members of Congress.</p>

Women members are more likely to focus on issues related to health care, poverty, and education. They have brought media attention to domestic violence and child custody. Members of minority groups raise issues pertinent to their constituents, such as special cancer risks experienced by Hispanics.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p01">Because disseminating information and generating publicity are keys to governing, gaining reelection, and moving careers forward, many members of Congress hungrily seek media attention.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p04">One member of Congress who continually flirts with being overexposed in the media is Senator <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Charles “Chuck” Schumer</a> (D-NY). Known as the consummate “show horse,” Schumer has been in public life and the media spotlight since being elected to the New York State Assembly at the age of twenty-three and then to the House of Representatives at twenty-nine. He became a US Senator in 1998 and has declared himself to be a “senator for life,” who does not have presidential aspirations. This claim gives him greater liberty to speak his mind in a manner that appeals to his New York constituency without worrying about pleasing a national audience. Schumer comes from modest means—his family owned a small pest extermination business—and has relied heavily on unpaid publicity to ensure his Senate seat. Over the years, the prolifically outspoken Schumer has earned a reputation for being one of the most notorious media hounds on Capitol Hill as well as one of the hardest working senators.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p05">Schumer hails from Brooklyn, to which he attributes his affinity for speaking his mind. “That’s one of the benefits of being a Brooklynite. You’re a straight shooter with people, and people are back with you. And sometimes you offend people.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_071">Mark Leibovich, “The Senator Has the Floor,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 15, 2005: C01.</span> While his Brooklynese may offend some, it generates headlines and plays well in New York, where he easily wins reelection campaigns.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p06">Schumer’s communications staff is one of the busiest on Capitol Hill. Numerous press releases on a variety of issues affecting his home state and national policy might be issued in a single day. On the same day he announced legislation that would reverse plans to require passports at the Canadian border, called for the suspension of President Bush’s advisor Karl Rove’s security clearance for allegedly revealing the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame, and publicized a list of twenty-five questions that should be asked of a Supreme Court nominee. This aggressive press strategy prompted his opponent in the 2004 election to pledge that he would “plant 25 trees to replace the trees killed last year to print Chuck Schumer’s press releases.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_072">Mark Leibovich, “The Senator Has the Floor,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 15, 2005: C01.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p07">Schumer’s penchant for the media has made him the punch line for numerous jokes by fellow members of Congress.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p01">Members have personal staffs to help them manage their work load. They also work with committee staff who specialize in particular policy areas. Most Hill staffers are young, white, male, and ambitious. Most members maintain a staff in their home districts to handle constituent service.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p02">Congressional staff has grown substantially since the 1970s as the number of policy issues and bills considered by Congress increased. Today, House personal staffs consist of an average of fourteen people. Senate staffs range in size from thirteen to seventy-one and average about thirty-four people.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_074">Roger H. Davidson and Walter J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p03">Congressional staffers have specialized responsibilities. Some staffers have administrative responsibilities, such as running the office and handling the member’s schedule. Others are responsible for assisting members with policy matters. Personal staffers work in conjunction with committee staffers to research and prepare legislation. They write speeches and position papers. Some act as brokers for members, negotiating support for bills and dealing with lobbyists. Staff influence over the legislative process can be significant, as staffers become experts on policies and take the lead on issues behind the scenes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_076">Susan Webb Hammond, “Recent Research on Legislative Staffs,” <em class="emphasis">Legislative Studies Quarterly</em> 21, no. 4 (November 1996): 543–76.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p04">Some staff members focus on constituent service. They spend a tremendous amount of time carefully crafting answers to the mountains of correspondence from constituents that arrives every day via snail mail, e-mail, fax, and phone. People write to express their views on legislation, to seek information about policies, and to express their pleasure or dissatisfaction about a member’s actions. They also contact members to ask for help with personal matters, such as immigration issues, or to alert members of potential public health menaces, such as faulty wiring in a large apartment building in the district.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p05">Members of Congress resisted using e-mail to communicate until recent years. Members were not assigned e-mail addresses until 1995. Despite the daunting flood of messages, e-mail has helped congressional offices communicate with constituents efficiently. While the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">franking privilege</a><span class="glossdef">The ability of Congress members to post mail without cost.</span></span>, members’ ability to post mail without cost, is still important, e-mail has reduced the significance of this perk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s08_s03_p06">All members of Congress have press secretaries to coordinate their interactions with the media. They bring a journalistic perspective to congressional offices, acting as consultants in devising media strategies. In recent years, the press secretary’s job has expanded to include using social media to publicize the member’s actions and positions. A press secretary for a publicity-seeking member who faces tough reelection bids constantly courts the media, making personal contacts, writing press releases, staging photo ops and events, and helping the member prepare video and audio interviews. The press secretary constantly updates the member’s Facebook and Twitter messages and YouTube videos. A press secretary for a member in a secure seat who prefers a low-key media presence concentrates on maintaining contact with constituents through newsletters and the member’s website.</p>

Still, the dominant profile of the member of Congress is an older, white male. In addition to their constitutional duties, members of Congress engage in a host of other activities, many of which are related to getting reelected. Members strive to maintain close connections with their constituents while serving in Washington. They seek to publicize their activities through the mainstream press as well as social media. Congressional staffers aid members in keeping abreast of policy issues, performing constituent service, and dealing with the press.</p>

The media environment has become more complicated to negotiate, as members must contend with both traditional news media and new media, which provide a two-way flow of information between legislators and their constituents.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Interactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p01">When asked by a <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine reporter to identify the most underplayed story of our times, former news anchor Walter Cronkite replied, “Congress. This is where our laws are made, where our laws are debated, and we don’t cover Congress the way it ought to be.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_077">“10 Questions for Walter Cronkite,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, November 3, 2003, 8.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p02">Cronkite’s observation speaks to the changing relations between the national press and Congress over time. For the first century of the republic, Congress and its members were far more visible in newspapers than presidents, who felt it was beneath the dignity of the office to speak on public issues. Debates on Capitol Hill were widely reprinted in partisan papers. The profit-minded penny press of the 1830s found Washington news attractive but often focused on members’ personal escapades, which raised the ire and suspicion of congressmen. Congress adopted the practice of reviewing reporters’ credentials, granting them permission to sit in the drafty public gallery on a case-by-case basis. When the Capitol was rebuilt in the 1850s, the construction included press galleries, separate areas to which reporters were automatically admitted on the recommendation of their editors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p03">By the 1920s, the president made most of the news; Congress was relegated to a distant second place, and the Supreme Court received the least press.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_078">Timothy E. Cook, <em class="emphasis">Making Laws &amp; Making News</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1989).</span> The modern relationship between the media and Congress took shape in the 1970s, when <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the story about the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the behest of the Nixon White House to uncover Democrats’ campaign strategies. Hundreds of reporters were sent to Washington to cover the Watergate scandal, and many stayed after discovering that the town was ripe with stories. The Watergate scandal prompted Congress to pass <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sunshine laws</a><span class="glossdef">Laws passed by Congress to open hearings to the public and the press.</span></span>, which opened most hearings to the public and the press. Many members welcomed the opportunity offered by the invigorated Washington press corps to promote themselves to their constituents.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Congress versus the President</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_s01_p01">There are a number of reasons why the president is the newsmaker-in-chief while Congress remains in his shadow. The president is a media magnet because he is a single individual at the hub of the executive branch. It is more difficult for reporters to cover Capitol Hill. Congress has many potential newsmakers and story lines that take journalists time and energy to track down. Congress also has been resistant to new communications technologies that might elevate its profile but at the same time subject members to greater public criticism. Radio journalists were not admitted to the press gallery until 1939. Television cameras filmed the opening session of the House in 1947; they would not be allowed back for almost thirty-five years. The institution did not begin to embrace the Internet until 1995, when websites for the House and Senate were established but used by only a handful of members. Only recently have members begun to embrace social media.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Congress Online</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s02_p01">The tradition-bound Congress embraced the Internet slowly. Political scientist Stephen Frantzich describes the situation: “One can almost hear the crunch of metal as one ancient institution and one new technology collide. For all the promises of cyberdemocracy and enhanced political linkages, in some ways the interface of Congress and the Internet is a match made in Hell. Divorce is not possible, but tensions are inevitable.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_079">Stephen E. Frantzich, “RepresNETation: Congress and the Internet,” paper presented at the American University Center on Congress and the Presidency conference on “Congress, the Internet, and Deliberative Democracy,” May 4, 2001.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s02_p02">Members were reluctant to change the way they conducted business and were wary of receiving a barrage of e-mail messages that would create more work for their overtaxed staffs. This attitude changed as members used the Internet to get elected, staff members became tech savvy, and constituents became Internet users. Today, all members communicate through online media, although some members are more sophisticated in their digital communication strategies than others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s02_p03">Websites are an important resource for members’ public relations efforts. They provide a platform for publicizing members’ views and accomplishments that can be readily accessed by reporters. Members use websites to present their image to the public without journalistic filters. Websites can promote grassroots support for members through tools, such as printable brochures and buttons. Websites have improved constituent service. They are “virtual offices” open twenty-four hours a day, providing information and opportunities for interaction.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Depictions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_p01">Media depictions of Congress are a mixed bag. National news coverage focuses on the institution of Congress and tends to highlight conflict and partisan bickering. Local news covers individual members and is more positive. Depictions of Congress in television and film often exaggerate stereotypes, such as the corrupt senator or the crusading House representative.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">News Coverage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s01_p01">The distinction between the institution of Congress and individual members is evident in media coverage. There are distinct differences in the tone, content, and scope of news reports on Congress in the national compared to local press. National news reports focus more on the institution than individual members. Stories emphasize the investigative side of reporting in that they seek the “smoking gun,” a problem, or a scandal. Reports convey the impression that Congress is populated by power brokers who are in the pocket of political insiders such as interest groups; reports often portray members of Congress as being ignorant of public concerns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s01_p02">Local media coverage focuses on members more than the institution. Journalists value the access they have to members when they come home to their districts. Few local media organizations have Washington bureaus, so they rely heavily on press releases, wire feeds, canned video, members’ websites, blogs, and social media. Members spend much more time courting the local press than national media. The local press serves as an intermediary between members and their constituents by focusing on the congressional stories most relevant to the district.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s01_p03">Local stories generally are more positive than national news reports. Journalists even may become unofficial cheerleaders for members. This does not mean that members never receive bad press from local news sources. During reelection bids, especially, local journalists emphasize their watchdog role, and reporting can become more critical of members.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_081">Danielle Vinson, <em class="emphasis">Local Media Coverage of Congress and Its Members</em> (Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, 2002).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s01_p04">When the media uncover evidence of a member of Congress misbehaving, the result is frenzied scandal coverage. In 2001, the press revealed that Rep. Gary Condit (D-CA) had been having an affair with Chandra Levy, an intern who had disappeared and whose remains were later found in Washington, DC. Representative Condit was dogged by journalists from both respectable and tabloid organizations, whose stories implied that he had something to do with Levy’s fate. Representative Condit lost his reelection bid. The story was headline news for months until the 9/11 terrorist attacks put it on the back burner. In 2011, a jury convicted another man in Levy’s murder.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s02_p01">Congress has been the subject of numerous television programs and movies. Like media coverage in general, television and film treatment of Congress pales in comparison to that of the presidency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s02_p02">There has been a stream of television sitcoms and dramas set in Congress, most of which have been short-lived. Programs exaggerate images of the institution that are predicated in reality. Others reinforce unflattering stereotypes of members as criminals or buffoons.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_082">Tracey L. Gladstone-Sovell, “Criminals and Buffoons: The Portrayal of Elected Officials on Entertainment Television,” in <em class="emphasis">It’s Show Time!</em>, ed. David A. Schultz (New York: Peter Lang, 2000), 119–32.</span> The television version of Congress is even more of a male bastion than the institution itself. Women primarily serve as support staff or love interests of male members. <em class="emphasis">Mister Sterling</em>, the congressional counterpart to <em class="emphasis">The West Wing</em> that survived one season, is typical. It featured an idealistic but all-too-serious young congressman who uses his intelligence to outsmart his older, white, male colleagues. Women members on the show were few, and none held leadership positions. Sterling used talk radio, which is dominated by male hosts and listeners, as his primary means of communicating to the public.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_083">Garrett Epps, “Sterling Character,” <em class="emphasis">The American Prospect</em>, January 17, 2003.</span> Another quickly cancelled program was <em class="emphasis">Women of the House</em>, in which a scatterbrained Southern belle inherits the Senate seat of her deceased fifth husband and schemes her way through her congressional duties.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s02_p03">Congress has been depicted in more than a dozen feature films since the 1930s, far fewer than the more than one hundred films that have focused on the presidency. Many of them overdramatize legislative processes and committee actions and oversimplify the workings of the institution. Floor action and committee hearings are ridden with conflict and full of surprises. In reality, floor action almost invariably proceeds by the rules with great decorum. The work of congressional committees is deliberate and complicated. On film, members of Congress are often pitted against one another. In fact, members rarely engage in direct confrontation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn12_084">David L. Paletz and Daniel Lapinski, “Movies on Congress,” in <em class="emphasis">The Encyclopedia of the United States Congress</em>, ed. Donald C. Bacon, Roger H.

Instead, she gains enough support to get the bill passed. A clip of <em class="emphasis">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em> (1939) is cleverly inserted into the film to position it in the tradition of films in which the young, idealistic underdog takes on the corrupt lifelong politician.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s03_s02_p05">Films depict members of Congress as politically and morally flawed.

Some scholars contend that because the media do not cover much of what goes on in Congress, members are largely able to do their jobs without interference. Members with high public visibility can get into trouble as they are subject to scrutiny and criticism.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s01_p03">A third, more realistic perspective posits that both the insider and outsider strategies are essential for lawmaking.

Some suggest that the image of an institution characterized by conflict and deal making that pervades media coverage has a negative impact on public perceptions. Most Americans abhor the squabbling between members and acrimonious interactions between Congress and the presidency that they see in the media.

On the one hand, Congress’s online presence fosters positive attitudes toward the institution and its members. Congressional websites have been successful in facilitating the flow of information to the public.

While mainstream media coverage of Congress is less prevalent than it is for the presidency, bloggers generate a continual barrage of commentary and criticism of congressional action, often taking aim at particular members. Citizens armed with cell phones and flip cameras can capture a member at her or his worst moment, post an embarrassing photo or video online, and have it go viral within a short period of time. These negative depictions can play into the unpopular view of Congress that citizens frequently hold and contribute to declining trust in the institution.</p>

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s04_p05">Testifying before Congress is not just for celebrities and policy wonks. Average citizens can make a powerful case for a cause in front of congressional committees, an act that is frequently covered by the press. Young people have testified on behalf of research for illnesses (e.g., diabetes and cancer), educational reform, credit card company practices, and a variety of other issues.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s04_p06">Vicky Flamand was a young single mother in Florida working a double shift and attending college part time. With an annual income of $13,500, she relied on government-subsidized child-care benefits to keep her tenuous lifestyle going. When the benefits expired, she reapplied, only to be turned down because the county had run out of funds. A hard worker who did not want to go on welfare, she bombarded public officials, including members of Congress, with letters and e-mails describing her plight and those of more than forty-six thousand families who were denied child care in Florida alone. As a result, she was asked to testify in front of the Senate Finance Committee in support of the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which funds transitional child-care benefits. She worked with the Children’s Defense Fund to prepare her testimony.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s04_p07">Flamand felt that the senators were attentive to her testimony and sympathetic to her story. She had a powerful ally in Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), a cosponsor of the bill, who mentioned her testimony in his official statement at the Senate Finance Committee hearing. “I was a little person who could put a face on a problem that was hurting many, many families,” Flamand said. “Testifying before Congress gave me confidence that I had the power to make a difference. You must make an effort to be heard. Someone, somewhere, will listen and hear you.” Flamand’s child-care benefits were restored, and she enrolled full time in college with the goal of attending law school.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s04_p08">Meeting face-to-face with political leaders is one of the best ways to present your concerns about a policy and to learn about how legislative institutions work. Despite their rigorous schedules, arranging for members or former members of Congress and their staffs to speak at your school or club is not as hard as it may seem. Members of Congress and their staffs often welcome the chance to meet with young people in their districts.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch12_s09_s04_s04_p09">Internships with members of Congress are an excellent way to get a real sense of how government works. There are many congressional internship opportunities available both in members’ personal offices on Capitol Hill and in state district offices and with congressional committees. Interns have a range of duties, including answering constituent mail, researching issues, preparing press releases, and helping with constituent service. They also do their fair share of grunt work—making photocopies, answering the phones, and running errands. Committee internships tend to offer greater opportunity for research and issue-related work than those in personal offices.</p>
