        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s00_p01">It has become commonplace for reality programs to hold elections. The <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em> winner is chosen in an elimination contest by receiving the most votes from viewers who, just like voters in regular elections, make decisions based on any number of reasons: voice, song selections, looks, gender, race, even hometown. True, in <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em>, people vote as often as they want by telephone and text message. On <em class="emphasis">Dancing with the Stars</em>, a voting controversy was set off when Bristol Palin survived poor performances and unfavorable ratings from the judges because partisan supporters of her mother, former Republican Alaska governor Sarah Palin, allegedly stuffed the electronic ballot box. Multiple voting, although illegal, has not been unknown in American elections; and distance voting may be a way of the future, freeing voters from traveling to the polling booth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p04">Relatedly, focus groups bring together a few people representative of the general public or of particular groups, such as undecided voters, to find out their reactions to such things as the candidate’s stump speech delivered at campaign rallies, debate performance, and campaign ads.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Funding Campaigns</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">“Money is the mother’s milk of politics,” observed the longtime and powerful California politician Jesse Unruh. The cost of organizing and running campaigns has risen precipitously. The 2008 presidential and congressional elections cost $5.3 billion dollars, a 25 percent increase over 2004.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_002">Brody Mullins, “Cost of 2008 Election Cycle: $5.3 Billion,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 23, 2008.</span> Around 60 percent of this money goes for media costs, especially television advertising. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfinst.org">Campaign Finance Institute</a> has a wealth of information about funding of American election campaigns.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Limiting Contributions and Expenditures</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p01">In an episode of <em class="emphasis">The Simpsons</em>, Homer’s boss tells him, “Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man could afford.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_003">“Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish,” <em class="emphasis">The Simpsons</em>, November 1990.</span> Spurred by media criticisms and embarrassed by news stories of fund-raising scandals, Congress periodically passes, and the president signs, laws to regulate money in federal elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal law originally passed in 1971 that limited the amount of money that individuals, political parties, and political groups could contribute to campaigns.</span></span> of 1971, amended in 1974, limited the amount of money that individuals, political parties, and political groups could contribute to campaigns and provided guidelines for how campaign funds could be spent. The FECA also provided a system of public financing for presidential campaigns. It required that campaigns report their financial information to a newly established enforcement institution, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Elections Commission (FEC)</a><span class="glossdef">The institution that oversees campaign finance, including campaign contributions and candidate expenditures.</span></span>, which would make it public.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p03">Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these laws in the federal courts, arguing that they restrict political expression.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_004">See Bradley A. Smith, <em class="emphasis">Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001); and John Samples, <em class="emphasis">The Fallacy of Campaign Finance Reform</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).</span> In the 1976 case of <em class="emphasis">Buckley v.

Valeo</em>, 424 US 1 (1976).</span> The Supreme Court argued that campaign spending was the equivalent of free speech, so it should not be constrained.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p04">This situation lasted for around twenty years. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“Hard money”</a><span class="glossdef">Funds, contributed directly to candidate campaigns, that are subject to government regulation.</span></span> that was contributed directly to campaigns was regulated through the FECA.

Soft money could be spent for political advertising as long as the ads did not ask viewers to vote for or against specific candidates. Nonparty organizations, such as interest groups, also could run issue ads as long as they were independent of candidate campaigns. The Democratic and Republican parties raised more than $262 million in soft money in 1996, much of which was spent on advertising that came close to violating the law.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_006">Dan Froomkin, “Special Report: Campaign Finance: Overview Part 4, Soft Money—A Look at the Loopholes,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, September 4, 1998.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p06">In April 2011 comedic news anchor Stephen Colbert announced his intention to form a “super PAC” to expose loopholes in the campaign finance laws that allow corporations to form political actions committees, which can spend unlimited amounts of money in elections on advertising. Colbert testified in front of the FEC and was granted permission to form his PAC, which would be funded by Viacom, the media corporation that owns Comedy Central, which hosts <em class="emphasis">The Colbert Report</em>. The decision sparked concern that media organizations would be free to spend unlimited amounts of money in campaigns; however, the FEC’s decision imposed the strict limitation that Colbert could only show the ads on his program. Colbert announced the FEC’s decision to allow him to form a PAC to raise and spend funds in the 2012 election in this video: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/391146/june-30-2011/colbert-super-pac---i-can-haz-super-pac-">http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/391146/june-30-2011/colbert-super-pac---i-can-haz-super-pac-</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p01">There are six main sources of funding for federal elections. These sources include individuals, political action committees, public funding, candidates’ contributions to their own campaigns, political party committees, and advocacy organizations or “527 committees.” Individuals contribute the most to election campaigns. Individual donations amounted to $1,330,861,724<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_010">Campaign finance data for the 2008 campaign are available at the Federal Election Commission, “Presidential Campaign Finance: Contributions to All Candidates by State,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/mapApp.do">http://www.fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/mapApp.do</a>.</span> for the 2008 presidential election cycle. People can give up to $2,300 to candidates for each primary, runoff, and general election; $28,500 annually to national political parties and $10,000 to each state party; $2,300 to a legal compliance fund; and as much as they want to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">political action committee (PAC)</a><span class="glossdef">Funds associated with business or labor organizations or with politicians and created in order to finance candidates’ campaigns.</span></span> and advocacy organizations. PACs were developed by business and labor to fund candidates. Politicians have also created PACs. They can give up to $5,000 per candidate per election. In 2008, they gave the second-largest amount: $5,221,500.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p02">Presidential candidates can opt for public funding of their election campaigns. The funds come from an income tax check-off, where people can check a box to contribute $3 to a public funding account. To qualify for public funding, candidates must have raised $100,000 in amounts of $250 or less, with at least $5,000 from each of twenty states. The first $250 of every individual contribution is matched with public funds starting January 1 of the election year. However, candidates who take public funds must adhere to spending limits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01">Most campaigns have a strategy to win an election by raising funds, recruiting volunteers, and gaining votes. Campaign strategies take into account voters’ party identification, the candidate’s image, and issues. Candidates carry out their strategy through retail politics and the media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p02">In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">retail politics</a><span class="glossdef">Campaign activity, also known as field operations, in which candidates engage in person-to-person encounters with potential voters.</span></span>, also known as field operations, candidates engage in person-to-person campaigning.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p03">If the campaign has sufficient funds, retail politics involves <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">microtargeting</a><span class="glossdef">Use of computers and mathematical models to identify people’s vote preferences based on a variety of factors ranging from their partisan preferences to their purchasing history.</span></span>, using computers and mathematical models to identify people’s vote preferences on the bases of the magazines they read, credit card purchases, and the cars they own.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_012">Leslie Wayne, “Democrats Take Page from Their Rival’s Playbook,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 31, 2008.</span> This information is used to woo undecided voters and ensure that supporters are registered and cast their ballot.

This may be easier said than done.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p01">Implementing strategy effectively requires staying on message. Candidates are like barkers at a fairground, each promoting his or her own show. At every opportunity they repeat their message, which is sometimes abbreviated into a slogan. In 1992 the main message of Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign was “It’s the economy, stupid,” which was aimed at blaming President George H. W. Bush for the country’s economic problems. Barack Obama’s campaign slogan in 2008, “Change we can believe in,” was a fresh take on a familiar call for change in American politics.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p02">Staying on message is not easy. Campaigns constantly have to react to unexpected events and to the other side’s statements and actions—all in a twenty-four-hour news cycle. They usually respond rapidly to new subjects and issues, deflecting, reframing, or exploiting them.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p03">Elections are crucial in a representative democracy like the United States. They enable people to choose their leaders and thereby influence public policy. They endow elected officials with legitimacy. There are two main types of elections: primary and general elections. Candidates from the same political party contest for the party’s nomination in primary elections. Candidates from different parties run in the general election, which decides who will take office.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p04">Campaign finance is an integral element of American elections. Individuals, PACs, public funds, political parties, candidates themselves, and 527 committees fund campaigns. Campaign finance laws have shaped the way that candidates raise and spend money in elections, especially presidential candidates who accept public funding.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s04_p05">Candidates engage in retail politics by meeting with voters on the campaign trail. Campaigns employ strategies that take into account party identification, candidate image, issues, and message cohesion.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_l01">
            <li>How do candidates present and use political advertising in their campaigns?</li>

            <li>What is the nature of campaign media coverage? How do campaigns attempt to influence election coverage?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_p02">Campaigns want to influence media coverage in their candidate’s favor. They seek to dominate the election agenda, frame and prime issues, and have the media transmit their message of the day. The proliferation and diversity of modes of communication makes this complicated. Campaigns attempt to control their political advertisements and influence debates. They try to set the news-media agenda, but the relationship is uncertain at best.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_014">For an award-winning study of media in the 1992 presidential election, see Marion R. Just, Ann N. Crigler, Dean E. Alger, Timothy E. Cook, Montague Kern, and Darrell M. West, <em class="emphasis">Crosstalk: Citizens, Candidates, and the Media in a Presidential Campaign</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Political Advertisements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Television and radio advertisements are essential elements of election campaigns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_015">See Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, <em class="emphasis">The Spot</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992); and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, <em class="emphasis">Packaging the Presidency</em>, 3rd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).</span> Ads capitalize on people’s beliefs and values. They are often designed to arouse emotions, such as anxiety and fear, hope and enthusiasm.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_016">Ted Brader, <em class="emphasis">Campaigning for Hearts and Minds</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).</span> They attract attention with dramatic visuals, sounds, and slogans. They sometimes exaggerate, even distort, information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Candidate advertising in the information age has become more complex as campaigns seek to disseminate their ads through multiple platforms. Candidates release ads on candidate and political-party websites and on video-sharing platforms, such as YouTube and Hulu. Ads also are posted or linked on news sites and blogs.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Ad Formats</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Ads come in many formats, but even now when glitzy techniques are available, the talking head, in which the candidate speaks directly to the audience, is common. Other formats are testimonials from people enthusiastically supporting the candidate and documentary ads utilizing footage of the candidate campaigning. Ads that utilize a “self-incrimination” of the opponent can be devastating. In 1992, the Clinton campaign ran an effective ad juxtaposing President George H. W. Bush’s positive comments about the economy with data showing its decline.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p02">Ads can use a panoply of visual and sound techniques. Distance (tight close-ups can be unflattering), angles (camera shots that look up make an individual seem more powerful), movement (slow motion suggests criminality), editing (people looking at a candidate with adoration or disgust)—all these techniques influence viewers’ reactions. Color also influences perceptions: blue reassures, red threatens. Candidates often are shown in flattering color while the opponent is depicted in sinister black and white. Morphing, electronically changing and blending photographs and other visuals, can identify candidates with unpopular figures, such as Adolf Hitler.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p02">Attack ads employ a number of techniques to convey their points. They can point out “flip-flops,” exposing apparent contradictions in the opponent’s voting record and public statements. They can chastise the opponent for “not being on the job” and missing votes. Ads can convey “guilt by association,” linking the opponent to unpopular individuals and organizations. Candidates can attempt to refute attack ads with denials, explanations, rebuttals, and apologies. However, many attack ads are effective in generating negative impressions of candidates. Rebuttals tend to repeat the original charge and prolong the ad’s visibility.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_019">Michael Pfau and Henry C.

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p03">The Daisy ad, an enduring attack ad, was designed for the 1964 election campaign of Democratic president Lyndon Johnson. It exploited the fear that Johnson’s Republican opponent, Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, was willing to use nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p04">The ad shows a little girl plucking the petals from a daisy as she counts down out of order from ten. A doomsday-sounding male voice takes over the countdown. At zero, there is a nuclear explosion, and the girl’s face turns into a mushroom cloud that fills the screen.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p05">Over the roar of the cloud, President Johnson intones, “These are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God’s children can live, or to go into the dark.” The word <em class="emphasis">stakes</em>, with its suggestion of being burnt at the stake, fits the Johnson campaign slogan, which ends the ad: “Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p06">The ad, which only ran once on television, never mentions Goldwater’s name. It was not necessary. People were soon informed by the news media that it referred to him. Outraged Republican leaders unintentionally publicized the ad, which only was aired once by the Johnson campaign. The news media replayed the ad, increasing its visibility and the negative effect it had on the Goldwater candidacy.</p>

This spin is essential because journalists’ judgments, more than the substance of the debate, influence public opinion.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_021">Diana Owen, “The Debate Challenge,” in <em class="emphasis">Presidential Campaign Discourse</em>, ed. Kathleen E. Kendall (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995), 135–55.</span> Journalists and pundits, in their instant analysis and polls of viewers, frame debates in terms of who won or lost. They focus on “defining moments,” identifying memorable lines and gaffes. In his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976, President Gerald Ford, trying to make a statement about the spirit of the East Europeans, said that the Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe. Although people watching the debate registered little reaction, reporters picked up on this apparent blunder and hounded Ford for days. Public opinion swung from seeing the debate as essentially a tie to seeing it as a crippling loss for Ford.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p01">The speed of the twenty-four-hour news cycle and the range of media outlets make it difficult for campaigns to control what the news media report.

The press highlights candidates’ attacks on one another, as well as conflicts, controversies, blunders, and gaffes. Scandal, such as misconduct in office and illegal drug use, sometimes brought to reporters’ attention by a candidate’s opponents and spread on the Internet’s rumor mills, is a news staple.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_023">See Stephen J.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p05">Candidates attempt to control their image, establish their campaign theme, and set the issue agenda through their campaign advertising. They design ads that will appeal to their supporters and reach out to undecided voters. Negative ads are prevalent in campaigns, as they can be effective in creating negative views of opponents and allowing voters to compare candidates.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p06">Debates allow voters to assess candidates one-on-one. Candidates seek to control debates by negotiating the logistics and engaging in intense preparation. Media engage in postdebate assessments of the candidates’ performances.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_p02">The presidential election gets the most prominent American campaign. It lasts the longest and receives far more attention from the media than any other election. The Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born US citizen, at least thirty-five years old when taking office, and a resident of the United States for at least fourteen years. It imposed no limits on the number of presidential terms, but the first president, George Washington, established a precedent by leaving office after two terms. This stood until President Franklin D. Roosevelt won a third term in 1940 and a fourth in 1944. Congress then proposed, and the states ratified, the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution, which limited the president’s term of office to two terms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Becoming a political party’s presidential nominee requires obtaining a majority of the delegates at the party’s national nominating convention. Delegates are party regulars, both average citizens who are active in party organizations and officeholders, who attend the national nominating conventions and choose the presidential nominee. The parties allocate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">convention delegates</a><span class="glossdef">Party regulars who attend the national nominating conventions and choose the presidential nominee.</span></span> to the states, the District of Columbia, and to US foreign territories based mainly on their total populations and past records of electing the party’s candidates.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p02">Most candidates begin building a campaign organization, raising money, soliciting support, and courting the media months, even years, before the first vote is cast. Soon after the president is inaugurated, the press begins speculating about who might run in the next presidential election. Potential candidates test the waters to see if their campaign is viable and if they have a chance to make a serious bid for the presidency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Delegates to the party nominating conventions are selected through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">caucuses</a><span class="glossdef">Meetings of party members at which delegates to the nominating convention are selected; these delegates then decide on the party’s nominee, who will run in the general election.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primaries</a><span class="glossdef">Elections in which party members vote for delegates to the nominating convention; these delegates then choose the party’s nominee, who will enter the general election.</span></span>. Some states hold caucuses, often lengthy meetings of the party faithful who choose delegates to the party’s nominating convention. The first delegates are selected in the Iowa caucuses in January. Most convention delegates are chosen in primary elections in states. Delegates are allocated proportionally to the candidates who receive the most votes in the state. New Hampshire holds the first primary in January, ten months before the general election. More and more states <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">front-load primaries</a><span class="glossdef">Primaries that states hold early in the process in order to increase their influence over who secures the presidential nomination.</span></span>—hold them early in the process—to increase their influence on the presidential nomination.

Conventions are designed to inspire, unify, and mobilize the party faithful as well as to encourage people who are undecided, independent, or supporting the other party to vote for its candidates.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_024">Costas Panagopoulos, ed., <em class="emphasis">Rewiring Politics: Presidential Nominating Conventions in the Media Age</em> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007).</span> Conventions also approve the party’s platform containing its policy positions, proposals, and promises.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Selecting the party’s nominees for president and vice president is potentially the most important and exciting function of national conventions. But today, conventions are coronations as the results are already determined by the caucuses and primaries. The last presidential candidate not victorious on the first ballot was Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1952. The last nominee who almost lacked enough delegates to win on the first ballot was President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p03">Presidential candidates choose the vice presidential candidate, who is approved by the convention. The vice presidential candidate is selected based on a number of criteria. He or she might have experience that compliments that of the presidential nominee, such as being an expert on foreign affairs while the presidential nominee concentrates on domestic issues. The vice presidential nominee might balance the ticket ideologically or come from a battleground state with many electoral votes. The choice for a vice presidential candidate can sometimes be met with dissent from party members.</p>

The statewide winner-take-all by state system obliges them to put much of their time and money into swing states where the contest is close. Except for Maine and Nebraska, states operate under a winner-take-all system: the candidate with the most votes cast in the state, even if fewer than a majority, receives all its electoral votes.</p>

That night, shouting over the din of his supporters, he committed to continuing his campaign and then let out a loud scream. The networks and cable news replayed the visual and shout, now described as “the scream heard around the political world,” hundreds of times, but without the loud audience noise over which he was attempting to be heard. He seemed a bit unbalanced and certainly not presidential. Parodies of “the scream” proliferated online.</p>

            <p class="para">The media endlessly replayed Democrat Howard Dean’s scream after the Iowa caucuses in 2004.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p02">After the Iowa caucuses the news media reported that Senator Kerry was likely to be nominated. Dean received less coverage than before, most of it negative. His support shrank by 50 percent in the polls, while Kerry’s popularity in the polls grew. Kerry won New Hampshire and other primaries, locking up the nomination on Super Tuesday, March 2.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p03">The theme of the Democratic convention and John Kerry’s acceptance speech centered on Kerry’s status as a Vietnam war hero with the strength and determination to be president, commander in chief, and to wage the war on terrorism. Missing from the convention were a vision and program for the future of the country. There were few attacks on President George W. Bush or his record. For these reasons, Kerry did not experience much of a postconvention bounce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p04">The Republicans renominated the incumbents, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who were unchallenged in their party’s caucuses and primaries. Their convention was held in New York City around the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and within staging distance of the ground zero site. The convention portrayed President Bush as a strong and decisive leader. Convention speakers attacked Kerry as weak, a waffler, and unqualified to be president. In his acceptance speech, President Bush laid out programs and policies he would pursue if reelected, which included security and defense in order to ensure that America “is safer.” In polls, his postconvention bounce ranged from 4 to 11 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p05">The Iraq War was an issue that posed problems for both candidates. For Bush, it was the continued insurgency against the US occupation and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction. He tried to finesse this by equating the war in Iraq with the war on terrorism. Kerry offered few alternatives to existing policy. He compounded his problem by saying in a speech at Marshall University about his vote for funding the war, “I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.” This statement, at best confusing, at worst contradictory, was a major news story the next day and was pounced on by the Bush camp.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p06">The Republicans had a wedge issue in same-sex marriage. For many months this subject had been prominent in the news. Eleven states had propositions on their ballots amending their constitutions to limit marriage to one man and one woman. An ad supporting this position used the sound of wedding bells to remind people that the amendment would protect traditional marriage. The issue primed people’s vote when evaluating the presidential candidates, attracting some Democratic voters to choose the Republican candidate.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p01">Campaigning focused on eighteen <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">battleground states</a><span class="glossdef">States that are highly contested where either candidate could win in a presidential election.</span></span> that either candidate could win, a number reduced as Election Day neared to Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_026">For the campaign from the consultants’ perspectives, see Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ed., <em class="emphasis">Electing the President, 2004: The Insider’s View</em> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005).</span> Candidates used their ads strategically in these states. Bush’s ads were more memorable and effective than Kerry’s. One “documents” Kerry’s supposed flip-flops by editing scenes of the senator wind surfing so that he goes one way then another to the accompaniment of Strauss’s “Blue Danube” waltz, while the voice-over states his different (contradictory) positions. The ad ends with this voice-over: “John Kerry: Whichever way the wind blows.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p02">The most damaging ads attacking Kerry were made by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. As a 527 organization, they relieved the Bush campaign of any responsibility for the ads and from having to justify or defend them. The first <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Swift Boat ad</a><span class="glossdef">An ad produced by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, challenging Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry’s Vietnam War record, that aired during the 2004 election.</span></span> opens with Kerry’s running mate, Senator John Edwards (NC), saying that the best way to understand Kerry is to “spend three minutes with the men who served with him.” The ad spliced together short interviews with veterans who accused Kerry of lying about his Vietnam War record and betraying his comrades by later opposing the war. The ad appeared in only a few states, but its incendiary charges dominated election-news coverage where the ad was shown repeatedly. Senator Kerry’s campaign waited two weeks before showing an ad responding to the accusations. In that time, the attack stuck, casting doubts about Kerry’s heroism, integrity, and fitness to lead the fight against terrorism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p03">Kerry revived his election prospects through his performance in televised presidential debates. Polls showed that Kerry won the first debate, as he appeared presidential and seemed to be more certain than his opponent in answering the questions. However, President Bush improved in the two subsequent debates. People do not necessarily equate winning a debate with deserving their vote.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p04">In 2004, the news media overwhelmingly emphasized the horse race. Only 18 percent of the stories on network news discussed candidates’ stands on policy issues, their qualifications, or previous records.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_027">Content analysis provided by Media Tenor.</span> Two events given prominent media coverage benefited the president: Chechen terrorists killed teachers and children in a school-hostage massacre in Beslan, Russia, and Osama bin Laden released a videotaped statement the weekend before the election. These events made the Republicans’ issue of the terrorism threat resonate with voters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p05">President Bush won the Electoral College 286 to 252. He gained 50.7 percent of the popular vote compared to 48.3 percent for John Kerry. Bush held all the states he had won in 2000 except for New Hampshire, and he picked up Iowa and New Mexico. The key state was Ohio with twenty electoral votes, which President Bush won with 51 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_p01">After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_l01">
            <li>In what ways did the 2008 election campaign stand out from other American presidential elections?</li>
            <li>What were the key issues in the 2008 campaign?</li>
            <li>What part did media play in the election?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_p02">The year 2008 marked the first time since 1952 that no incumbent president or incumbent vice president was a candidate in the presidential election. Media speculation about the possible Democratic and Republican nominees started earlier than ever before. The field of candidates seeking the nomination for both parties was large. Senator John McCain became the Republican nominee, and Senator Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination. The 2008 election witnessed unprecedented use of social media, such as Facebook, and video-sharing media, like YouTube, by candidates, journalists, and voters.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nominating Campaign</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p01">Eleven men competed for the Republican nomination. The leading candidates were former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and Senator John McCain of Arizona. McCain had been written off by pundits the previous summer when his campaign was in disarray and out of money. He placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses but continued to campaign, winning the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. Both Giuliani and Romney withdrew after disappointing primary performances, leaving Huckabee to run against McCain. The Arizona senator swept the four primaries on March 5, giving him a majority of the total number of delegates for the nomination.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p02">Senator McCain surprised pundits and politicians by choosing little-known Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate. During the primaries, the senator had been attacked by conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing commentators as being too liberal. Putting Palin on the ticket aimed to placate conservatives and appeal to women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p03">Eight men and one woman competed for the Democratic nomination. Bias against women seeking elective office by party elites, fund-raisers, the media, and voters has greatly diminished, but obstacles remain for women aspiring to be president. Women face gender stereotyping that calls into question their ability to lead the country, and they must overcome the fact that the president has always been male.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_028">Lori Cox Han and Caroline Heldman, eds., <em class="emphasis">Rethinking Madam President: Are We Ready for a Woman in the White House?</em> (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishes, 2007); also Jennifer Lawless and Richard L. Fox, <em class="emphasis">It Takes a Candidate: Why Women Don’t Run for Office</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</span> Hillary Clinton sought to overcome these odds. She had name recognition and fund-raising prowess from her eight years as First Lady and her election as senator from New York. Her most formidable challenger was Barack Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois and an African American (more accurately, he is of mixed race, from a Kenyan father and white American mother). The Democratic primary was a landmark contest between the first female candidate and first African American candidate to make a serious bid for the presidency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p04">The campaign for the Democratic nomination was hotly contested. Hillary Clinton’s campaign made several strategic mistakes and lacked a coherent message. Obama ran the more effective campaign and was able to make his call for “change” resonate with voters. Both campaigns had sophisticated websites that not only included the usual biographical and issue information but also featured videos, ads, and interactive features that allowed users to participate in the campaign by donating, volunteering, posting messages and videos, and recruiting supporters. The Obama campaign also made extensive use of microtargeting, designing specialized messages delivered through e-mail and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">podcasts</a><span class="glossdef">Digital audio or video pieces distributed by political campaigns, parties, and interest groups about a candidate, issue, or event that can be accessed conveniently on a computer or handheld digital device.</span></span> that appealed to particular voters, such as young professionals who frequent Starbucks and use Blackberries to communicate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p05">Clinton lost to Obama in the first contest, the Iowa caucus. She recovered by winning the New Hampshire primary. On <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Super Tuesday</a><span class="glossdef">A Tuesday, usually in February or March, when a large number of states hold their presidential primary elections.</span></span>, a date when a large number of states hold their primaries, Clinton won nine of twenty-two primaries, including California, New York, and New Jersey. Obama won the other thirteen and subsequently went on to take twelve straight caucus and primary states. Clinton won primaries in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, while Obama gained North Carolina and Indiana and picked up most of the delegates in the remaining caucus states. Clinton stayed in the race until June 7, 2008, when she withdrew and endorsed him. With 2,118 delegates needed to win the nomination, she had 1,923, and he had 2,154. Obama also had the support of 463 of the nonelected super delegates compared to 257 who backed Clinton. As his running mate, Obama chose longtime Delaware senator Joseph Biden, who possessed the Washington and foreign-policy experience he lacked.</p>

    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Images and Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s02_p01">Media images of the candidates varied widely. On the one hand, Barack Obama was portrayed positively as an American success story. Abandoned by his father when he was two, he was raised by a single mother who struggled financially, he worked his way through law school, and he was elected to the United States Senate. Alternately, he was depicted as a black man with a strange name and as an elitist with a Harvard law degree and radical ideas. Depictions of John McCain also were greatly at odds. McCain was shown to be an experienced leader, wise in the ways of national security, and as a maverick not wedded to Republican orthodoxy. On the other hand, he was portrayed as a tired, old Washington politician and as a conventional conservative averse to change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s02_p02">The Democrats were able to capitalize on campaign issues that worked against the Republicans, the party of the incumbent president, George W. Bush, whose popularity was low. The fading economy took precedence over terrorism. The Iraq war was increasingly seen as a mistake to be ended. Obama denounced the Bush administration and attacked his opponent, stating, “I am not going to be Bush but McCain will.” He promised to respond to the problems of energy, education, and health care. He stated that taxes would be raised, but only for the wealthy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The General Election</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s03_p01">One of the hallmarks of the Obama campaign was its superior use of new media. His website was more sophisticated that McCain’s, despite the fact that McCain was one of the first candidates to use the Internet for fundraising when he had previously sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. His website included “My Neighborhood” profiles of voters in the same zip code; “Take Action Now” e-mail alerts; and “National Voter Protection Center,” a space for reporting voting irregularities.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_029">Matthew R. Kerbel, <em class="emphasis">Netroots</em> (Boulder, CO: Paradigm Press, 2009).</span> The Obama campaign had its own media channel, where viewers could tune in to campaign events. The campaign used digital tools to develop an e-mail list and collect millions of cell phone numbers of potential voters. The campaign also harvested cell phone numbers of millions of potential voters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s03_p02">Obama opted out of the public financing system and raised nearly $750 million. McCain took public financing and received $84 million to spend from his party convention to Election Day. Obama outspent McCain in battleground states by more than four to one. Obama had funds to air a half-hour prime-time “infomercial” on network and cable television just before the election.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s05_s03_p03">During the campaign, uncertainty about Sarah Palin’s qualifications for the vice presidency were raised. Her performance in the vice presidential debate showed weaknesses in her command of foreign-policy issues. In addition, the news media reported that the Republican National Committee had spent $150,000 at upscale department stores for her campaign wardrobe. Palin was further undermined by Tina Fey’s imitations of her on “Saturday Night Live,” which became popular online videos that were downloaded millions of times.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s06_p02">Every two years the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate face election. Congressional elections command far less attention from the media and voters than do presidential campaigns. However, their outcomes can determine the partisan composition of Congress, which can influence the course of public policy for decades to come. Americans can have a direct say in state policy proposals, laws, and constitutional amendments through ballot measures.

Typically, there is less media coverage of midterm elections compared with presidential campaigns.

Having been in office for six or more years, incumbents have records, controversial votes, and may have upset some of their constituents. Their opponents may have name recognition, ample funding, and run an effective campaign using the new media and political advertising. Especially when the election is close, challengers receive almost as much visibility as incumbents. They are able to publicize their images, get some of their issues on the campaign agenda, and have attention paid to their attacks on their opponent.</p>

The majority of incumbents won, but many faced tough competition. Thirteen Democratic incumbents ran for reelection and three lost, while all eleven Republican incumbents seeking reelection won. Candidates spent record amounts of money contesting in Senate campaigns. Sharron Angle, who won the Nevada Republican Senate nomination with the backing of the grassroots Tea Party movement, spent ninety-seven dollars per vote in the general election, which she lost to Democrat Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate, who spent sixty-nine dollars per vote.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_031">T.

They run for high office, usually the presidency or Senate. The focus is on their character. Either they are cynical and hypocritical from the start (the presidential candidate played by John Travolta in <em class="emphasis">Primary Colors</em>, 1998), or they become cynical and compromise their ideals and principles over the course of their campaigns (the senatorial candidate played by Robert Redford in <em class="emphasis">The Candidate</em>, 1972), or they are disillusioned career politicians trying but failing to change a corrupt campaign process (Warren Beatty as the senator up for reelection in <em class="emphasis">Bulworth</em>, 1998). Their campaign consultants use whatever tactics and techniques will win the election. The candidates have an adversarial relationship with the news media.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_s03_p04">Documentaries offer a wider range of candidates and circumstances. <em class="emphasis">The Perfect Candidate</em> (1996) covers Republican Oliver North’s 1994 senatorial campaign in Virginia from the perspective of the candidate, his campaign manager, and a <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reporter.

Campaigning is an all-consuming activity requiring perseverance and the sacrifice of personal life. Money is crucial for their campaigns, and they spend a lot of time trying to raise it. They engage in retail politics: shaking hands, meeting people, visiting senior-citizen centers, and marching in parades. They struggle to break through to an indifferent electorate; yet, even after they have campaigned for several months, many people remain unaware of them. They are vulnerable to the news media, which defines and depicts them.</p>

In 2010, 74 percent of House candidates and 81 percent of Senate candidates with the most Facebook friends won their elections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s01_s01_p02">People use digital media to participate in new ways, often outside the context of campaign organizations. Facebook, Delicious, LiveJournal, Foursquare, Twitter, and Tumblr are used for political expression and networking. These platforms are versatile, and allow users to post their support for a candidate, link to outside content, such as a candidate’s website, share photos and videos, express opinions, and share comments. In 2008, 5.4 million people used the “I voted” button on Facebook to let their friends know that they had taken part in the election. More than 12 million people clicked on this button in the 2010 midterm campaign.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s01_s01_p03">The mainstream media have incorporated social media into their election coverage. News organization websites feature social media applications, such as Facebook links. In 2010, the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> sponsored a promoted trend, #Election, on the Twitter.com homepage to allow users to view election coverage. The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> and CNN analyzed voter tweets as part of their campaign reporting.</p>

This video was viewed millions of times and generated thousands of comments. It sparked a tidal wave of user-produced campaign videos.</p>

Perhaps the most popular video of the 2008 campaign was “Obama Girl…Cause I got a crush on Obama.” The video, which first aired in November 2007, starred aspiring actress-model Amber Lee Ettinger wearing a bikini and lip-synching a song about her love for Obama. “Obama Girl” prompted copycat videos for other candidates, including the “Fabulous McCain Girl,” who turns into the Incredible Hulk as she defends her candidate.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_s01_p01">Candidates and their spouses participate in popular culture and go on entertainment shows to display their human touch, identify with ordinary folk, and connect with members of an audience that is otherwise hard to reach. Their ability to influence the contents of these shows varies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_s01_p02">Easiest are shows with hosts such as Oprah and Larry King because they usually ask softball questions easy to anticipate and answer.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_s01_p03">Candidates go on late-night talk shows, engaging in conversation with hosts Jay Leno and David Letterman.

Some of these interchanges may be less spontaneous and more controlled by the candidates than it appears. According to Jay Leno, “Plenty of times when politicians are here, we write jokes for them.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_s02_p01">Campaigns have some influence over the contents of the cable television shows that generate commentary through the legions of candidates’ representatives and party strategists ushered in and out of the studios. However, they often are granted insufficient time to make their cases, which can result in argument and conflict rather than constructive discussion.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_s02_p02">Campaigns’ influence with commentators also varies. These editorialists, columnists, and pundits are paid to have opinions and express them. Some of them are open to argument and persuasion. Others—such as staunch conservatives Rush Limbaugh on radio and Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly on Fox TV, and liberal Rachel Maddow on MSNBC—are impervious to the efforts of candidates and campaign media advisors they disagree with to change their minds. They are more inclined to transmit the message of the day or talking points (perspectives and arguments) of a candidate with whom they agree and promote.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Consequences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p01">The election media environment is fast paced and saturated with information. The Internet enables campaigns to send journalists a barrage of e-mails containing endorsements, policy pronouncements, negative information about the opponent, and instant responses to news stories. Campaigns can post ads and videos of candidates for journalists to use in their reports. The new media make available reams of election-related content—an endless swirl of poll data, commentary, speculation on sites such as RealClearPolitics.com, Politico.com, and HuffingtonPost.com. Partisan argument abounds on blogs such as Daily Kos and Instapundit, providing insights, passion, humor, and rambling screeds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p02">The electoral environment, with its plethora of traditional and new media sources, can overwhelm voters with information. Despite this abundance, voters are not well informed about issues, which take a backseat to the horse race in campaign reporting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p03">Journalists check the accuracy of candidates’ statements, compare past votes and positions with current assertions, and analyze political advertisements. The media themselves are watched, checked, and corrected by sites like campaigndesk.org, mediamatters.org, and daily-howler.com. Yet, it is challenging for reporters to fact-check carefully and meet the demands of the twenty-four-hour news cycle. Bloggers and other commentators who are not schooled in journalistic practices and ethics can disseminate information without checking its veracity. As a result, voters increasingly encounter misleading information during elections. Forty-two percent of voters believed that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, a fallacy that was widely circulated in all types of media.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn11_047">Clay Ramsay, Steven Kull, and Evan Lewis, “Misinformation and the 2010 Election: A Study of the U.S. Electorate,” <em class="emphasis">WorldPublicOpinion.org</em>, Program on International Policy Attitudes, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, December 10, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/dec10/Misinformation_Dec10_rpt.pdf">http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/dec10/Misinformation_ Dec10_rpt.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p04">Candidates must be more guarded than ever. Any careless or provocative comment can be caught on camera and immediately distributed around the world. Incidents from the past, preserved on tape, can haunt candidates. A media feeding frenzy developed around Delaware Republican Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell, who was backed by the Tea Party, as a result of statements that she had made on “Politically Incorrect” with Bill Maher in 1999 that she had “dabbled in witchcraft” when she was in high school. The clip was circulated through social media and made national news. O’Donnell lost the election.</p>

Candidates, voters, and journalists must contend with a wide array of old and new media platforms. While traditional media primarily serve to inform voters, new media also involve voters in campaigns and help them to interact with others. Candidates’ appearances in entertainment media as well as discussions on commentary programs can influence voters’ perceptions. Today, candidates face intensive scrutiny not only from journalists but also from average people who report their actions using new media.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p06">One of the primary goals of American civic education is to prepare young people to take part in election campaigns. Traditionally, this involves studying the democratic principles underlying elections, learning how the electoral process works, registering to vote and locating a polling place, and acquiring the basic skills necessary to follow campaigns through mainstream media. All of these things are fundamental precursors to exercising the right to vote.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p07">In the current era, civic education also needs to take into account the new ways that people are engaging in elections. The next generation of voters should be schooled in how social media and other digital tools can be used in campaigns. Young people have been effective in developing new media election applications. They have innovated with established formats, such as campaign websites and blogs, to produce content that is more appealing to younger voters. Online versions of college newspapers have featured first-person accounts of campaign events using streaming video and interviews with candidates from dorm rooms. Young people were among the first to use Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter for campaign participation. As the number of platforms continues to evolve, such as microblogging sites like Tumblr, young voters will surely be among the first to develop them for campaign use.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch11_s07_s03_p08">Young people are ahead of the curve in using new media, compelling candidates to catch up. While candidates have incorporated social media into their campaigns, they have not always made good use of these platforms. Young citizens can be essential to campaign organizations in getting candidates up to speed with new media.</p>
