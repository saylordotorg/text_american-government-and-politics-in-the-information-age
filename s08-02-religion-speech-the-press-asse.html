        <h2 class="title editable block">Freedom of Religion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The First Amendment addresses freedom of religion in two distinct clauses: the establishment clause and the free expression clause.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Establishment Clause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p01">Rejecting the British legacy of “established” churches, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">establishment clause</a><span class="glossdef">Section of the First Amendment that prohibits the government from recognizing an official religion.</span></span> bars Congress from giving any religion an official status. In Jefferson’s much-quoted line, the establishment clause erects a “wall of separation between church and state.” A public policy may advance religious objectives only if its aim and main effect have nothing to do with religion. Thus a law forcing stores to close on Sundays can be justified to require employers to give staff a day off but not to enforce a Sabbath.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_009"><em class="emphasis">Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>, 403 US 602 (1971).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p02">The separation of church and state has generated high-profile controversies. The drama surrounding such confrontations is often captured by the press. In the 1920s, John Thomas Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee law requiring that the Bible’s version of creation be taught in public schools. Scopes’s trial, portrayed in the stage play and film <em class="emphasis">Inherit the Wind</em>, was a precursor of later battles.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p04">Starting in the 1960s, the Supreme Court, in a series of rulings, prohibited nondenominational state-issued prayers in school, Bible readings, moments of silence intended for prayer, and student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies and football games. (The Court did refrain from invalidating the Pledge of Allegiance for containing the words “under God.”)<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_010">Respectively, <em class="emphasis">Engel v.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Free Exercise Clause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p01">The First Amendment also says that Congress shall not prohibit the “free exercise” of religion. Individuals have the right to believe and practice their religions as they see fit. Government policies cannot target individuals’ religious practices or force actions that violate their religions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p02">This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free exercise clause</a><span class="glossdef">Section of the First Amendment that prohibits the government from barring individuals from freely practicing religion.</span></span> gained potency in 1943 when the Supreme Court ruled that Jehovah’s Witnesses could not be expelled from public schools for refusing to salute the American flag, an act contrary to their religion. More recently, the Supreme Court limited the clause’s reach when it ruled, in 1990, that American Indians had no right to disobey an Oregon law barring controlled substances in order to ingest peyote as part of a religious service. The Court held that laws hindering religious practices do not violate the First Amendment if they apply to all persons and do not openly refer to religion.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p03">The establishment clause tries to keep religion out of government; the free exercise clause tries to keep government out of religion. The two objectives are not always compatible. For example, President George W. Bush proposed to allow government to contract with “faith-based” organizations to administer social programs. Opponents argued that this would violate the establishment clause by endorsing religion; Bush responded that existing policy violated the free exercise clause by discriminating against religious organizations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Freedom of Speech</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">The Supreme Court has held that “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_011"><em class="emphasis">New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, 376 US 254 (1964).</span> Offensive speech is less detrimental than the “chilling effect” of individuals being silenced for fear of retribution. Nevertheless, freedom of speech is not absolute. Governments can regulate or restrict it under certain conditions.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Thoughts, Words, and Actions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01_p01">Thoughts are deemed beyond the scope of government regulation; actions are heavily regulated by government; words are somewhere in between. The distinctions between thoughts, words, and actions are not always clear. Two cases of protest against the Vietnam War show how lines are drawn.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_012"><em class="emphasis">United States v. O’Brien</em>, 391 US 367 (1968); and <em class="emphasis">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</em>, 393 US 503 (1969).</span> In one, a protester burned his draft card and was charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime to knowingly destroy draft cards. The Court upheld the law, saying that the law aimed to maintain draft records, not to stifle free expression. When two students wore black armbands to their high school to protest the war and were suspended for violating the dress code, the Court found the policy sought to suppress free expression and sided with the students.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">When Speech Can Be Regulated</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p01">The First Amendment does not protect speech that fails to contribute to the exchange of ideas that is crucial in a democracy—for instance, libel, obscenity, and “fighting words”—but such forms of speech are narrowly defined.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p02">The publication of defamatory information, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">libel</a><span class="glossdef">Defamatory publication unprotected by the First Amendment; to win a libel suit, public figures must demonstrate “actual malice” revealed by a “reckless disregard for the truth.”</span></span>, can be challenged in court. But officials and other public figures must demonstrate “actual malice” displayed by a “reckless disregard for the truth.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_013"><em class="emphasis">New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, 376 US 254 (1964).</span> Thus libel cases are hard to win. Nonetheless, some litigants sue to shame a media organization publicly or to force it to spend money defending itself in court.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p03">There is now a right to possess most obscene material in one’s home, but not to produce, sell, or ship it. Early in the twentieth century, obscenity laws had halted the circulation of works of art such as James Joyce’s now classic novel <em class="emphasis">Ulysses</em>. In 1957, the Supreme Court shrank the definition of obscenity from anything to do with sex to “material that deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest” and “utterly without redeeming social importance.” This decision forced the justices to hear dozens of cases in order to distinguish obscenity from protected speech. The results were almost comical. The often elderly justices viewed numerous pornographic films, the earthy Thurgood Marshall recounting the goings-on to his patrician, sight-impaired colleague John Harlan. At one point, Justice Potter Stewart exasperatedly wrote in one opinion, “I know it when I see it.” Finally, in 1973, the Court established three rules that must be met for material to be obscene: it appeals to a prurient interest by the standards of the local community; it depicts specified sexual conduct in a patently offensive way; and it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_014">The key cases here are <em class="emphasis">Roth v. United States</em>, 354 US 476 (1957); <em class="emphasis">Stanley v. Georgia</em>, 394 US 557 (1969); and <em class="emphasis">Miller v. California</em>, 413 US 15 (1973).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p04">In the 1920s, the Supreme Court allowed government to bar <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fighting words</a><span class="glossdef">Speech, not protected by the First Amendment, that provokes people to immediate attack or acts of violence.</span></span> as long as there was a “clear and present danger” of provoking an immediate attack or acts of violence. In Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s terms, freedom of speech does not extend to the right to falsely yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater. Such a rule allowed for suppression of radical voices. As late as 1951, the Court upheld a federal law banning advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government. But the Court, in 1969, held that speech favoring illegal action is protected unless violence is both intended and likely.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_015">Respectively, <em class="emphasis">Schenck v. United States</em>, 249 US 47 (1919); <em class="emphasis">Dennis v. United States</em>, 341 US 494 (1951); and <em class="emphasis">Brandenburg v. Ohio</em>, 395 US 444 (1969).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s02_p05">Even when the government cannot bar speech, it can direct its time, place, and manner. But policies may not target particular content and must provide alternative ways to express oneself. If public universities and colleges cannot ban political speeches, they may restrict them to certain parts of campus such as “Free Speech Alleys.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s03_p01">Like fighting words, intimidation and harassment are not protected forms of free speech. By this logic, colleges and universities in the 1980s proposed campus speech codes to forbid the demeaning or stigmatizing of persons on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Proponents argued that speech codes would actually boost free speech, since “hate speech” deterred individuals who felt under attack from speaking out. But courts struck down the codes as too broad.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_016">James B.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_p01">The government is rarely able to stop material from being published. Even the Sedition Act of 1798, discussed previously in this chapter (<a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch04_s01#paletz_1.0-ch04_s01">Section 4.1 "The Bill of Rights"</a>), did not include this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prior restraint</a><span class="glossdef">A practice, forbidden by the First Amendment, whereby government can prevent publication.</span></span>. The Supreme Court extended the ban to the states in 1931 when it struck down a Minnesota law allowing the state to suppress a “malicious, scandalous and defamatory” publication as a “public nuisance”—in this case, an abusively anti-Semitic periodical. Prior restraint is rarely justified: in 1971, the Court refused to issue an injunction sought by the executive branch against the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> and <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> on grounds of violations of national security. In the absence of the government’s <em class="emphasis">proof</em> that the national interest would be harmed, the Court allowed the publication of the Pentagon Papers, a leaked classified set of documents revealing decisions leading to the Vietnam War.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_017"><em class="emphasis">Near v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p02">Laws aimed at public disclosure, such as sunshine laws preventing government from working behind closed doors, benefit reporters.

Such information can also reveal scandals. In 1990, <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> reporter Ann Devroy was frustrated with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu’s refusal to answer her dogged questions about his rumored use of perquisites of office for private gain.

Four students, including two passersby, died. A photographer snapped fifteen-year-old runaway Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling and screaming over Jeffrey Miller’s dead body. Another showed National Guardsmen, impersonal under gas masks, aiming rifles at defenseless students. Such images conjure up brutal, deliberate repression of rights of protest.

A balanced assessment of the literature is Thomas R. Hensley and Jerry M. Lewis, eds., <em class="emphasis">Kent State and May 4th: A Social Science Perspective</em> (Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt, 1978).</span> Protests began on college campuses on April 30, 1970, when President Richard Nixon announced an invasion of Cambodia, expanding the Vietnam War. Protests were not always peaceful. In Kent, students smashed store windows on May 1, and Kent State’s ROTC building was burned down on May 2. Ohio’s governor mobilized the National Guard to defend the campus. On May 4, the Guard, badly outnumbered, sought to stop the rally. Other photos from May 4 show students taunting the Guard, fogs of tear gas, and volleys of empty tear-gas canisters and rocks thrown at soldiers. The picture of soldiers aiming their rifles may have been an early attempt to subdue the protest without shooting. The immediate response to the shootings did not blame the Guard. Nixon’s reaction was widely reprinted: “This should remind us all once again that when dissent turns to violence it invites tragedy.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_023">Quoted in Sue Schuurman, “Kent State Killings Shock Nation: 28 Years Ago This Week,” <em class="emphasis">Weekly Alibi</em>, May 11, 1998, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-11-98/alibi_skeleton.html">http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-11-98/alibi_skeleton.html</a>.</span> Polls showed most of the public blamed students for the deaths and backed the Guard’s actions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_024">See the Gallup poll from <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, May 25, 1970, 30, cited in James J.

One reason is its emotional resonance: it resembles a Pietà sculpture of Mary grieving over the body of Jesus. Also, American politics after the invasion of Cambodia turned from engaging in to ending the Vietnam War—in part as a response to unrest that racked the country. And President Nixon’s law-and-order rhetoric lost support as revelations of illegal misdeeds surfaced in the Watergate scandal. By the fall of 1973, a majority in a Harris poll saw the shootings as “unjustified and repressive.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn04_025"><em class="emphasis">New York Post</em>, October 3, 1973, as reported in J.
