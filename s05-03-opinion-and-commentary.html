    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_p02">The media do far more than report the news. They are full of pundits, talking heads, and partisans who are busy expressing opinions and commenting on the news. These reactions and responses can contribute to a marketplace of ideas, informed public discussion, and greater understanding of politics, government, and public policies. Often, however, they result in conflict and cacophony: topics are broached too briefly in too little time, assertions dominate analysis, and shouting and squabbling drown out thought.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">Most newspapers contain editorials expressing opinions about the events of the day. The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>’s stance is liberal; the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>’s is conservative. They supplement their editorials with opinion columns from regular contributors. A few newspapers add op-eds. These are opinions from people unaffiliated with the paper. Some newspapers carry a range of opinions, others are ideologically monolithic. Cartoons, when the newspaper features them, often comment critically on public officials, policies, and current events. Comic strips are sometimes politically provocative, for example Gary Trudeau’s sardonic <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.doonesbury.com"><em class="emphasis">Doonesbury</em></a> and Aaron McGruder’s scathing <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gocomics.com/boondocks"><em class="emphasis">The Boondocks</em></a>. These strip writers first published their work in their campus newspapers at Yale and the University of Maryland, respectively.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">The nonpartisan magazines <em class="emphasis">National Journal</em> and <em class="emphasis">Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report</em> cover government and politics focusing on Washington, DC. Other magazines provide a spectrum of analysis and opinion, ranging from the conservative <em class="emphasis">National Review</em> and <em class="emphasis">Weekly Standard</em>, through the <em class="emphasis">New Republic</em>, to the liberal <em class="emphasis">Nation</em> and <em class="emphasis">Progressive</em>. All have relatively small readerships.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Television</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">After much debate among members of Congress, televised coverage of floor proceedings via the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) was established in the US House of Representatives in 1979 and in the Senate in 1986 (C-SPAN2) to transmit gavel-to-gavel coverage of floor action. These channels plus C-SPAN3 also air an array of political events, including election debates, political advertisements, press conferences, discussion forums, and interviews with news makers, journalists, and authors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">The television networks’ Sunday morning interview programs usually feature prominent policymakers, including government officials and well-known politicians. There is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608"><em class="emphasis">Meet the Press</em></a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/ftn/main3460.shtml"><em class="emphasis">Face the Nation</em></a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek"><em class="emphasis">This Week</em></a>. In the face of sometimes aggressive questioning by the host and interview panelists, guests strive to set the news agenda and get their messages across to viewers. The programs, which have small audiences, are influential because they are widely watched in Washington, DC, otherwise known as “inside the beltway,” and by people interested in government and politics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p03">There are also shows featuring journalists discussing current events among themselves, whether more combatively (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mclaughlin.com"><em class="emphasis">The McLaughlin Group</em></a>) or less (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek"><em class="emphasis">Washington Week</em></a>).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p04">Twenty-four-hour cable-television news channels report the news. For example, CNN has <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/situation.room"><em class="emphasis">The Situation Room</em></a> with Wolf Blitzer. But they have a lot of time to fill and only a limited number of reporters and news-gathering resources. So they employ opinionated anchors and fill their news programs with commentary and opinion, often from pundits, political consultants, party strategists, and people from interest groups and ideological think tanks. These guests, many of whom appear regularly (no matter how wrong their past observations), disagree forcefully with each other, speak in sound bites, and are adept at memorizing and delivering “spontaneous” quips.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_035">David Brooks, “Live from 400,” <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, November 13, 2000, 122.</span> Even though these shows have relatively small audiences, the people watching “are the news junkies, the ones who get the buzz going.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_036">Marlin Fitzwater quoted in Martha Joynt Kumar, <em class="emphasis">Managing the President’s Message: The White House Communications Operation</em> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), 197.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p05">For a mainly conservative, pro-Republican, anti-Democrat perspective there is cable’s most popular news channel, Fox Cable <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com"><em class="emphasis">News</em></a>.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_037">A documentary film exposing what it sees as the pro–Republican and Bush administration coverage by the Fox News Channel is <em class="emphasis">Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch’s War on Journalism</em>.</span> Despite its claims to separate news from opinion, the two often blend together. The channel features partisan, opinionated talk-show hosts and commentators, notably the combative <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hannity.com">Sean Hannity</a>, the sophistic <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.glennbeck.com">Glenn Beck</a>, and the pugilistic populist <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/index.html">Bill O’Reilly</a>. Stating his opinions bluntly and skewering some of his guests, O’Reilly has made his Fox show cable television’s most popular public affairs program. All three use multiple media platforms in addition to the Fox News Channel—radio talk shows, books, and websites—to spread their messages. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org"><em class="emphasis">Media Matters for America</em></a> attacks the programs and positions of Fox News, especially Glenn Beck, and is attacked in return.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p06">MSNBC is cable’s liberal opposition to the conservative Fox News.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p01">Over two thousand radio stations employ a news-talk format. Hosts have ample time to vent their opinions and cultivate, cajole, and castigate their callers and listeners.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_038">Annie M. Brewer, <em class="emphasis">Talk Shows &amp; Hosts on Radio</em>, 2nd ed. (Dearborn, MI: Whitefoord Press, 1993).</span> The bulk of the talk-radio audience listens to hosts who express conservative opinions, are pro-Republican and hostile to liberals, Democrats, and feminists. The most conspicuous is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html">Rush Limbaugh</a>. This caustic conservative is the most widely heard (on more than six hundred stations with an estimated weekly audience of more than 13.5 million) and influential of all radio commentators. Promoting the conservative side, he castigates liberals with humor, often sliding into insult, sneer, and exaggeration.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_039">For a study of the similarities and relationships of Limbaugh, Fox News and the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, see Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph N. Cappella, <em class="emphasis">Echo Chamber: Rush Limbaugh and the Conservative Media Establishment</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p02">From a countervailing, liberal-radical perspective, there is the Pacifica Network, particularly its evening news program <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.democracynow.org"><em class="emphasis">Democracy Now</em></a>, hosted by Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez and heard on approximately nine hundred stations. It reports stories and interviews people rarely hear on mainstream, let alone conservative, media.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p03">There are approximately 1,500 Christian programming stations. In addition to their inspirational religious content and music, they broadcast programs on marriage and family issues and advice for the troubled. Some of their content is relevant to politics and public policy, especially their espousal of and support for traditional views and values.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">Comedy can venture where other entertainment forms fear to tread. Comedy has a point of view, presents an argument, and often lacerates, usually from a liberal perspective (as, for example, <em class="emphasis">Saturday Night Live</em>’s fake news segment).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p02">Comedy Central’s <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailyshow.com"><em class="emphasis">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em></a> satirizes the news media and the politics and government they depict, especially the president. Jon Stewart, the acerbic yet charming host, confronts and analyzes the dissembling pronouncements of people in government. The show’s fake correspondents parody the behavior of real reporters to reveal the limitations of news formats and of objectivity. The show’s effects are achieved through Stewart’s comments and interjections, the incisive writing, and the clever editing of videos.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_040">For a thoughtful analysis, see Geoffrey Baym, “The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism,” <em class="emphasis">Political Communication</em> 22, no. 3 (July–September 2005): 259–76; and Jeffrey P. Jones, <em class="emphasis">Entertaining Politics: New Political Television and Civic Culture</em> (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p03">On rare occasions, Stewart has tried to influence public policy. In December 2010, he effectively pushed (embarrassed, shamed) congressional Republicans to pass a bill they had been blocking that would approve funding for medical benefits to firefighters, police officers, and health workers who had become sick from working at Ground Zero on and after 9/11. In one program he interviewed four of the first responders who had become ill.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p01">A series of experiments has demonstrated that when television news places more attention and emphasis on certain issues, such as crime, the public tends to see those issues as more important problems requiring government action. The public then judges politicians according to how well they respond to the issues.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_042">Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder, <em class="emphasis">News That Matters: Television and American Opinion</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p02">Consider the television show <em class="emphasis">24</em>. It told its viewers that terrorists were a constant threat to the United States and likely to strike with horrible destructiveness anywhere at any time. At its peak, the show had a weekly audience of approximately fifteen million viewers and reached millions more through DVD sales.</p>

The flip side of agenda setting is that when the media ignore issues or policy areas, so too does the public.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p01">The media are not simply important in getting people to think about an issue; they influence <em class="emphasis">how</em> people think about it. Scholars refer to this media power as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">framing</a><span class="glossdef">The central idea or theme with which media personnel organize a story and thus give it a point of view.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_043">Brian F. Schaffner and Patrick J. Sellers, <em class="emphasis">Winning with Words: The Origins and Impact of Political Framing</em> (New York: Routledge, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p02">Journalists bring a perspective to bear on events, highlight certain aspects at the expense of others, to create a coherent narrative.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_044">Stephen D. Reese, Oscar H. Gandy Jr., and August E. Grant, eds., <em class="emphasis">Framing Public Life: Perspectives on Media and Our Understanding of the Social World</em> (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2001).</span> Such a narrative names protagonists and antagonists, identifies some of the causes of the event described, outlines moral judgments, and may suggest solutions. Framing is inherent in the process of selecting, editing, organizing, and presenting stories. It is often expressed in the television anchorperson’s introduction and in newspaper headlines and opening paragraphs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p03">The meaning of an event can change dramatically based on how it is framed by and in the media. For example, the public understands a demonstration quite differently depending on whether the news frames it as an exercise of freedom of speech or as a threat to law and order.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p04">Of course, some frames are more convincing than others. A frame’s impact may depend on who is promoting it, what other frames it is competing against, and how frequently it is repeated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p05">Often, though, news frames are predictable.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_045">Daniel C. Hallin, <em class="emphasis">The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), 116–17.</span> They express widely shared assumptions and values. The news media framed the events of 9/11 as terrorist attacks on the United States with a response from Americans of national heroism, horror, and mourning.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p06">Out of habit and to simplify complex subjects, journalists tend to cover government and politics with a relatively small repertoire of familiar frames. Relations within and between the branches of government are typically framed as conflicts. Stories often frame politicians as motivated by partisanship and the desire for reelection. Stories about government agencies are frequently framed around bureaucratic incompetence, waste, and corruption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p07">Framing influences politics by reinforcing or changing what people think of an issue. Different frames call for different policy solutions. Thus <em class="emphasis">24</em> told its viewers that in the grim choice between security and liberty, coercion must prevail, that torture is essential to extract information from terrorists to forestall (usually just in time) their lethal schemes. According to Human Rights First, the number of acts of torture on prime-time television increased from fewer than four before 9/11 to more than a hundred. It used to be the villains who tortured, now it is the heroes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_046">See Jane Mayer, “Whatever It Takes,” <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, February 19 &amp; 26, 2007, 66–82, esp. 66 and 68.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p01">Media frames can provide criteria that audience members use to make judgments about government institutions, public officials, and issues. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">When media (news stories) ascribe responsibility for a problem to a person or institution.</span></span>. It can occur when news stories identify the person or institution to blame for an event, such as the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. The president is often held responsible for the nation’s problems. Priming effects are strongest “when the news frames a problem as if it were the president’s business, when viewers are prepared to regard the problem as important, and when they see the problem as entangled in the duties and obligation of the presidency.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn01_047">Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder, <em class="emphasis">News That Matters: Television and American Opinion</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 97 and 110.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p02">Because of its intrinsic importance, reemphasized by the news and entertainment media, fighting terrorism continues as a prominent issue. The president is seen as primarily responsible. Presidential candidates’ competence to combat terrorism thus becomes an important criterion by which the electorate judges them. Note, in this respect, that some of <em class="emphasis">24</em>’s presidents could not be trusted to execute that duty and obligation effectively.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p03">The media can influence people in politics without the public being involved at all. Politicians are far more voracious consumers of the news than is the average American. When issues are heavily covered in the media, officials take such prominence as a sign that they may well be called to account for their actions, even if the public has not yet spoken out. And they speak and behave differently than they did when the issues were obscure. Media attention tends to encourage action and speed up the policy process, if only for politicians to get the issue off the table.</p>
