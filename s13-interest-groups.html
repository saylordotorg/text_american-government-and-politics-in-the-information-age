    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s00_p01">The media often depict interest group lobbyists negatively in the news and in entertainment. One particular episode of <em class="emphasis">The Simpsons</em> provides an extreme example. Lisa Simpson writes an essay titled “The Roots of Democracy” that wins her a trip to Washington, DC, to compete for the best essay on patriotism award. She writes, “When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings…and as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s00_p02">In Senator Bob Arnold’s office a lobbyist proposes to raze the Springfield National Forest. Arnold responds, “Well, Jerry, you’re a whale of a lobbyist, and I’d like to give you a logging permit, I would. But this isn’t like burying toxic waste. People are going to notice those trees are gone.” The lobbyist offers a bribe, which Arnold accepts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s00_p03">Lisa sees it happen and tears up her essay. She sits on the steps of the Capitol and envisions politicians as cats scratching each other’s backs and lobbyists as pigs feeding from a trough. Called to the microphone at the “Patriots of Tomorrow” awards banquet, Lisa reads her revised essay, now titled “Cesspool on the Potomac.” A whirlwind of reform-minded zeal follows. Congressman Arnold is caught accepting a bribe to allow oil drilling on Mount Rushmore and is arrested and removed from office. Lisa does not win the essay contest.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_001">Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Sam Simon, and George Meyer, “Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington,” <em class="emphasis">The Simpsons</em>, Season 3, Episode 2, originally aired September 26, 1991. This episode is loosely based on the movie <em class="emphasis">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em>.</span></p>

These groups make demands on government and try to influence public policies in their favor. Their most important difference from political parties is that they do not seek elective office. Interest groups can be single entities, join associations, and have individual members. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a> is an educational institution. Its main purposes are teaching and research. Like other educational institutions, it is an interest group when it tries to influence government policies. These policies include government funding for facilities and student grants, loans, and work study. It may also try to influence laws and court decisions applying to research, admissions, gender equality in intercollegiate sports, and student records. It may ask members of Congress to earmark funds for some of its projects, thereby bypassing the normal competition with other universities for funds based on merit.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_002">James D.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_p03">Single entities often join forces in associations. Associations represent their interests and make demands on government on their behalf. The University of Texas belongs to the Association of American Universities. General Electric (GE) belongs to over eighty trade associations, each representing a different industry such as mining, aerospace, and home appliances.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_003">Kay Lehman Schlozman and John T.

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_p04">Many interest groups have individuals as members. People join labor unions and professional organizations (e.g., associations for lawyers or political scientists) that claim to represent their interests.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Interest Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Interest groups can be divided into five types: economic, societal, ideological, public interest, and governmental.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Interest Groups</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p01">The major economic interest groups represent businesses, labor unions, and professions. Business interest groups consist of industries, corporations, and trade associations. Unions usually represent individual trades, such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Most unions belong to an association, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aflcio.org">American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p02">Economic interest groups represent every aspect of our economy, including agriculture, the arts, automobiles, banking, beverages, construction, defense, education, energy, finance, food, health, housing, insurance, law, media, medicine, pharmaceuticals, sports, telecommunications, transportation, travel, and utilities. These groups cover from head (i.e., the Headwear Institute of America) to toe (i.e., the American Podiatric Medical Association) and from soup (i.e., the Campbell Soup Company) to nuts (i.e., the Peanut Butter and Nut Processors Association).<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_004">Jeffrey H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_s02_p01">Societal interest groups focus on interests based on people’s characteristics, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as religion and sexual preference.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_s03_p01">Ideological interest groups promote a reactionary, conservative, liberal, or radical political philosophy through research and advocacy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p01">Interest groups commonly experience a life cycle of creation (or birth), growth and change (or evolution), and sometimes death.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Creation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p01">As the United States has become more complex with new technologies, products, services, businesses, and professions, the US government has become more involved in the economy and society. People with common interests organize to solicit support and solutions to their problems from government. Policies enacted in response to the efforts of these groups affect other people, who then form groups to seek government intervention for themselves. These groups may give rise to additional groups.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_005">This is known as disturbance theory. It was developed by David B. Truman in <em class="emphasis">The Governmental Process: Political Interests and Public Opinion</em>, 2nd ed. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971), chap. 4; and it was amplified by Robert H. Salisbury in “An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups,” <em class="emphasis">Midwest Journal of Political Science</em> 13 (1969): 1–32.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p02">Some interest groups are created in reaction to an event or a perceived grievance. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nrlc.org">National Right to Life Committee</a> (NRLC) was founded in 1973 in response to the US Supreme Court’s <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> decision earlier that year legalizing abortion. However, groups may form long after the reasons for establishing them are obvious. The NAACP was not founded until 1909 even though segregation of and discrimination against black people had existed for many years.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s02_p01">Interest groups can change over time. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nra.org">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) started out as a sports organization in the late nineteenth century dedicated to improving its members’ marksmanship. It became an advocate for law and order in the 1960s, until its official support for the 1968 Gun Control Act brought dissension in its ranks. Since the election of new leaders in 1977, the NRA has focused on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, opposing legislation restricting the sale or distribution of guns and ammunition.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_006">Scott H. Ainsworth, <em class="emphasis">Analyzing Interest Groups: Group Influence on People and Policies</em> (New York: W. W. Norton, 2002), 87–88.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s02_p02">Interest groups can also die. They may run out of funds. Their issues may lose popularity or become irrelevant. Slavery no longer exists in the United States and thus neither does the American Anti-Slavery Society.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Interest Groups Are Organized</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p01">Interest groups have leaders and staff. They control the group, decide its policy objectives, and recruit and represent members.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Leaders and Staff</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s01_p01">Leaders and top staff usually run the interest group. They do so because they command its resources and information flow and have the experience and expertise to deal with public policies that are often complex and technical. Almost a century ago, Robert Michels identified this control by an organization’s leaders and staff and called it “the iron law of oligarchy.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_007">Robert Michels, <em class="emphasis">Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy</em> (New York: Dover Publications, 1959; first published 1915 by Free Press).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s01_p02">This oligarchy, or rule by the few, applies to single-entity interest groups and to most associations. Their leaders are appointed or elected and select the staff. Even in many membership organizations, the people who belong do not elect the leaders and have little input when the leaders decide policy objectives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_008">Scott H. Ainsworth, <em class="emphasis">Analyzing Interest Groups: Group Influence on People and Policies</em> (New York: W. W. Norton, 2002), 114–15.</span> Their participation is limited to sending in dues, expressing opinions and, if membership is voluntary, leaving when dissatisfied.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Voluntary Membership</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s02_p01">People join membership interest groups voluntarily or because they have no choice.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s02_p02">When membership is voluntary, interest groups must recruit and try to retain members. Members help fund the group’s activities, legitimize its objectives, and add credibility with the media.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s02_p03">Some people may not realize or accept that they have shared interests with others on a particular issue. For example, many young adults download music from the Internet, but few of them have joined the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://futureofmusic.org">Future of Music Coalition</a>, which is developing ways to do this legally. Others may be unwilling to court conflict by joining a group representing oppressed minorities or espousing controversial or unpopular views even when they agree with the group’s views.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_009">Scott Sigmund Gartner and Gary M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s02_p04">People do not need to join an interest group voluntarily when they can benefit from its activities without becoming a member. This is the problem of collective goods. Laws successfully lobbied for by environmental organizations that lead to cleaner air and water benefit members and nonmembers alike. However, the latter get a free ride.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_010">See Mancur Olson Jr., <em class="emphasis">The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965).</span></p>

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">purposive incentive</a><span class="glossdef">When people join a group to accomplish its goals.</span></span> leads people voluntarily to join and contribute money to a group because they want to help the group achieve its goals. Membership in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) increased by one hundred thousand in the eighteen months following the 9/11 attacks as the group raised concerns that the government’s antiterrorism campaign was harming civil liberties.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_011">Eric Lichtblau, “F.B.I.

The motivation to join the group stems from the pleasure of interacting with like-minded individuals and the gratification of publicly expressing one’s beliefs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s02_p06">People may also join groups to obtain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">material incentives</a><span class="glossdef">When people join a group for the goods and services it provides.</span></span> available only to members. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</a>, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, has around thirty-five million members.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s03_p01">One way interest groups recruit members is through media coverage. The appealingly named <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cspinet.org">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a> (CSPI) is a consumer organization that focuses on food and nutrition issues, produces quality research, and has media savvy. It is a valuable source of expertise and information for journalists. The frequent and favorable news coverage it receives brings the group and its activities to the public’s attention and encourages people to support and join it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s03_p02">News coverage of an interest group does not always have to be favorable to attract members. Oftentimes, stories about the NRA in major newspapers are negative. Presenting this negative coverage as bias and hostility against and attacks on gun owners, the group’s leaders transform it into purposive and solidary incentives. They use e-mail “to power membership mobilization, fund raising, single-issue voting and the other actions-in-solidarity that contribute to [their] success.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_012">Brian Anse Patrick, <em class="emphasis">The National Rifle Association and the Media: The Motivating Force of Negative Coverage</em> (New York: Peter Lang, 2002), 9.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s03_p03">Groups also make personalized appeals to recruit members and solicit financial contributions. Names of people who might be sympathetic to a group are obtained by purchasing mailing lists from magazines, other groups, and political parties.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s04_p01">Employment in most automobile plants requires that workers are members of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.uaw.org">International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America</a> (UAW). Workers fought to establish unions to improve their wages, working conditions, and job opportunities. One way of achieving these objectives was to require all workers at a plant to be union members. But union membership has plummeted as the United States has moved from a manufacturing to a service economy and employers have effectively discouraged unionization. Many jobs do not have unions for workers to join whether they want to or not. Today only about 12 percent of workers belong to a union compared to a high of 35.5 percent in 1945. Only 7 percent of private sector workers belong to a union. A majority of union members now work for the government.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s05_p01">One reason for the decline of unions is their mainly negative portrayal in the mass media.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_013">William J. Puette, <em class="emphasis">Through Jaundiced Eyes: How the Media View Organized Labor</em> (Ithaca, NY: ILR Press, 1992).</span> There are hardly any labor-beat reporters in the news media, so union officials are infrequently used as sources and are consequently unable to frame union news to their advantage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_s05_p02">Strikes are the union action most often shown in the news. These are usually framed not as legitimate collective tactics to improve wages and working conditions, but as hurting or inconveniencing consumers by disrupting services (e.g., suspending classes in elementary and high schools) and causing the cancellation of events (e.g., professional sporting games).<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_014">For an exception, see Deepa Kumar, <em class="emphasis">Outside The Box: Corporate Media, Globalization, and the UPS Strike</em> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_p01">Interest groups become involved in elections to influence policymakers. They may contribute funds, make independent expenditures, advocate issues, and mobilize voters. Wealthy groups help pay for the presidential nominating conventions and the presidential inauguration.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_s01_p01">Interest groups may endorse candidates for office and, if they have the resources, mobilize members and sympathizers to work and vote for them. President Bill Clinton blamed the NRA for Al Gore losing the 2000 presidential election because it influenced voters in several states, including Arkansas, West Virginia, and Gore’s home state of Tennessee. Had any of these states gone for Gore, he would have won the election.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_s01_p02">Interest groups can promote candidates through television and radio advertisements. During the 2004 presidential election, the NRA ran a thirty-minute infomercial in battleground states favoring President George W. Bush and calling his opponent “the most anti-gun presidential nominee in United States history.” In 2008, the NRA issued ads endorsing Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_s01_p03">Endorsements do carry risks. If the endorsed candidate loses, the unendorsed winner is likely to be unsympathetic to the group.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_s02_p02">However, in January 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections.

Most PAC funds, especially from corporations, go to incumbents. Chairs and members of congressional committees and subcommittees who make policies relevant to the group are particularly favored. The case of Enron, although extreme, graphically reveals such funding. Of the 248 members of Congress on committees that investigated the 2002 accounting scandals and collapse of the giant corporation, 212 had received campaign contributions from Enron or its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_018">Don Van Natta Jr., “Enron’s Collapse: Campaign Finance; Enron or Andersen Made Donations to Almost All Their Congressional Investigators,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 25, 2002, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/business/enron-s-collapse-campaign-finance-enron-andersen-made-donations-almost-all-their.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/business/enron-s-collapse-campaign-finance-enron-andersen-made-donations-almost-all- their.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s01_s04_s02_p05">The interest group–candidate relationship is a two-way street. Many candidates actively solicit support from interest groups on the basis of an existing or the promise of a future relationship. Candidates obtain some of the funds necessary for their campaigns from interest groups; the groups who give them money get the opportunity to make their case to sympathetic legislators. A businessman defending his company’s PAC is quoted as saying, “Talking to politicians is fine, but with a little money they hear you better.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_019">Mark Green, “Political PAC-Man,” <em class="emphasis">New Republic</em> 187, no. 24 (December 13, 1982): 18.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_p03">The more policies the government proposes, the more lobbyists become involved. In response to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Obama administration proposed to overhaul the regulation and increase oversight of the financial system. This generated a bonanza of business for lobbyists. Lobbyists represented banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and credit card companies as well as companies in manufacturing, retail, and service who could be affected by changes in the laws.</p>

Wright, <em class="emphasis">Interest Groups and Congress</em> (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1996), 9–10.</span> Some of them go through a revolving door between government service and lobbying. Former presidential aides are prominent and powerful among them. More than two hundred lobbyists are former members of Congress. Others have worked for congressional committees or the agencies they now lobby. These former public servants have expertise, access, and contacts among policymakers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p02">This move from public service to private enrichment, cashing in on connections, is grist for the news media. The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reported that Wall Street’s financial firms had more than 125 former members of Congress and congressional aides working to limit the policies proposed by the Obama administration and the Democratic majority in Congress to overhaul and intensify regulation of the industry. They included Richard H. Baker, a former chairman of a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee. As president of the hedge funds’ Managed Funds Association, Baker led the fight to prevent government oversight of hedge funds.

Asked by the <em class="emphasis">Times</em>’ reporter if he had an edge in lobbying, one of them replied, “The answer is yes, it does. If it didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to justify getting out of bed in the morning and charging the outrageous fees that we charge our clients, which they willingly pay.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_023">Eric Lichtblau, “Ex-Regulators Get Set to Lobby on New Financial Rules,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 27, 2010, accessed on March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/28lobby.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/28lobby.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p04">Lobbyists also take positions in the federal government. They bring expertise from their jobs and usually take a pay cut.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Lobbying is done by members of the group’s or association’s staff, a law or lobbying firm that specializes in representing clients before government, or both. In addition to lobbying, firms may offer such services as public relations, research, polling, direct-mail, and grassroots campaigns.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_024">The Center for Responsive Politics has compiled a comprehensive database of lobbyist activities. “Lobbying Database,” Center for Responsive Politics, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.php">http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.php</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p01">Lobbyists need <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">access</a><span class="glossdef">The opportunity to meet with and communicate with policymakers.</span></span> to policymakers in order to make their cases. But public officials are not obliged to meet with lobbyists, take their telephone calls, or look at their e-mail messages. Access is granted when the policymaker has received campaign contributions from the group, is sympathetic to its interests, or the group’s policy objectives are important to constituents back home.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p02">Ensuring access often involves building relationships. Lobbyists attend elected officials’ fund-raisers and receptions and hand over campaign checks from their groups. They meet policymakers informally at dinners, golf games, sporting events, parties, and weddings. They enable lawmakers to fly on corporate jets at discounted rates and then join them for the ride. However, legislation has limited some of these benefits.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_s02_p01">After being granted access, lobbyists try to convince public officials to support or accept or, at least, not oppose the interest group’s policy positions. They provide three types of information. First, they provide information about current or proposed laws and regulations that are relevant to the group’s interests. Second, they supply political information about whether the policymakers’ constituents would be affected by a new policy and whether public opinion would support or oppose a policy change. Third, they offer technical information about the implications and possible effects of policy proposals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p01">Some interest groups encourage their members and others to contact their legislators on behalf of a policy position the group advocates. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grassroots lobbying</a><span class="glossdef">A strategy pursued by interest groups to influence elected officials by having their constituents contact them.</span></span>. Hired firms use data banks, telephone banks, and direct mail to contact people likely to be responsive to the group. Messages are crafted through focus groups and surveys. All this costs money. So grassroots lobbying is mainly done by amply funded interest groups on major public policy issues like the minimum wage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p02">Lobbyists may have extensive involvement with members of Congress and their staff in personal, committee, and leadership offices. Some lobbyists intervene from the start of the congressional policymaking process, encourage or discourage the introduction of proposed legislation, and try to influence its contents. They may draft a bill and work with congressional staff to sign up cosponsors. They may help organize congressional hearings, decide on the timing of the hearings, identify people to testify, write testimony for some of them, and provide questions for legislators to ask witnesses.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_025">Rogan Kersh, “Corporate Lobbyists as Political Actors: A View from the Field,” in <em class="emphasis">Interest Group Politics</em>, 6th ed., ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p03">Lobbyists may be involved with the subcommittee or committee markup of a bill. They may attempt to modify its language, add amendments, and work to have the bill approved or defeated by subcommittee or committee vote. They try to persuade members to vote for or against the bill on the floor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p04">These activities take place in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the House-Senate conference committee held to reconcile and resolve differences between bills passed by each chamber, and in the final House and Senate votes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p05">Lobbyists can also try to influence the amount of money Congress appropriates for agencies and programs. After the US Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in October 1997, the company called upon lawmakers to approve the lowest possible budget for the department. Its objectives were to punish the Justice Department and reduce its enforcement funds.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_p02">Presidents can cater to interest groups they favor or that have supported them or whose support they seek by pushing policies the interest groups desire. Usually, these are policies the president favors anyway. For example, President George W. Bush imposed restrictions on stem cell research, while President Barack Obama removed these restrictions shortly after taking office.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s04_p03">Interest groups supporting a presidential proposal can try to convince members of Congress with whom they have influence to vote in its favor. The White House may solicit such support as the George W. Bush administration did to gain the endorsement of AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) and an expensive advertising campaign in support of the bill adding drug coverage to Medicare. But interest groups may not be permanent or even reliable allies. For example, in 2005 AARP opposed President Bush’s proposal to “reform” Social Security.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p01">Bureaucrats are important to interest groups because they usually have leeway to decide what laws mean and how to administer and implement them.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s06_p04">Certain interest groups use the courts as the main way to try to achieve their objectives. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) often brings cases before the courts to assert and protect constitutional rights. During the 1970s the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project, headed by Ruth Bader Ginsburg (later to be appointed to the Court by President Clinton), filed the majority of cases that challenged discrimination against women and were heard by the Supreme Court.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s07_p08">The media’s negative depictions of lobbying and the concern of members of Congress to refute accusations of being beholden to “special interest groups” (a derogatory term) have produced proposals to regulate lobbyists and lobbying. These are designed to correct abuses, placate the media, and reassure the public. They increase the amount of information about and the visibility of lobbying, eliminate the appearance of corruption, and may reduce lobbyists’ influence over the policymaking process.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s07_p02">Jack Abramoff’s meteoric rise began in 1995, soon after the Republicans took over Congress and interest groups and lobbying firms hired lobbyists connected to Republican legislators and conservative organizations. His lobbying successes started with keeping the government of the Northern Mariana Islands, an American territory in the Pacific, exempt from American labor laws; the islands’ factories could pay their workers a pittance yet still label their products “Made in America.” Then he saved a Native American tribe, the Mississippi Band of Choctaws, hundreds of millions in possible taxes by helping defeat a proposal to tax casino revenues. Other Native American tribes hired him, as he worked to defeat legislation to subject them to state taxes.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s02_s07_p03">Initial media coverage of Abramoff was favorable.

Preventing legislation from being enacted is usually easier than passing it. In a comprehensive study of interest group activities during the last two years of the Clinton administration and the first two years of the George W. Bush administration, researchers found that although some advocates succeed eventually in changing policy, “[t]he vast bulk of lobbying in Washington has to do not with the creation of new programs, but rather with the adjustment of existing programs or with the maintenance of programs just as they are.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_041">Frank R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s05_p01">Whether interest groups defend what they have or go on the offense to gain new benefits often depends on who is in control of the government. Some interest groups’ goals are supported or opposed far more by one political party than another. A new president or a change in party control of Congress usually benefits some groups while putting others at a disadvantage. The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2010 election put a brake on new regulation of business by Congress, reduced funds for regulators to hire staff and enforce regulation, and limited investigations of industry practices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s05_p02">Crises, especially ones extensively depicted by the media, often involve politicians and interest groups trying to achieve or prevent policy changes. Looking to exploit the horrific BP (British Petroleum) oil spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico (which was widely covered in the media and replete with images of the oil-infested waters and oil-coated beaches and wildlife), environmentalists and their congressional allies worked for “measures to extend bans on new offshore drilling, strengthen safety and environmental safeguards, and raise to $10 billion or more the cap on civil liability for an oil producer in a spill.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_045">Eric Lichtblau and Jad Mouaward, “Oil Companies Weigh Strategies to Fend Off Tougher Regulations,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 2, 2010, accessed March 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/us/03lobby.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/us/03lobby.html</a>.</span> Opposing them were the oil and gas industry, which, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, spent $174.8 million on lobbying in 2009, and its allies in Congress from such oil states as Texas and Louisiana.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p01">When viewed overall, there is a hierarchy in the influence of relations between interest groups and policymakers.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_046">These categories come from Samuel J. Eldersveld, “American Interest Groups,” in <em class="emphasis">Interest Groups on Four Continents</em>, ed. Henry W. Ehrmann (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1958), 187.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>At the top, the interest group makes policy. This is uncommon.</li>
            <li>More common, the group maintains close political relations with policymakers.</li>
            <li>The group has an unchallengeable veto status over some governmental decisions, for example, over a presidential appointment.</li>
            <li>The group receives some attention from policymakers but mainly has a pressure relationship with them.</li>
            <li>The group has only a potential reprisal relationship with policymakers; it can threaten to oppose a member of Congress at the next election.</li>
            <li>At the bottom of the ladder, rejected by policymakers, the group is left to agitate and resist; its public demonstrations usually signify its inability to achieve its objectives by less visible means.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p02">The relationships between interest groups and policymakers vary depending on the administration in power. Energy companies had a close political support and referral relationship with the George W. Bush administration but primarily a pressure relationship with the Obama administration. Relationships also vary by subject. For example, a Democratic president’s choice to head the US Department of Labor may have to be acceptable to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), but the union organization has little influence over other cabinet appointments.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p01">A few interest groups engage in advocacy campaigns through the media. A notable example took place during the 1994 attempt by the Clinton administration to change the US health-care system. Some $60 million was spent on advertising, with opponents outspending supporters two to one.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p02">The Health Insurance Association of America (now named <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ahip.org">America’s Health Insurance Plans</a>), representing small to medium-sized insurance companies, waged the most effective public campaign. Under the appealing name of the Coalition for Health Insurance Choices, it spent around $14 million creating and showing television ads in which a woman (Louise) and her spouse (Harry) critically comment on alleged defects in the president’s health-care proposal. “Having choices we don’t like is no choice at all,” says Louise in one ad. No direct reference was made to the health insurance industry behind the ad.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p03">The ads were aimed at members of Congress and thus aired mostly in Washington, DC, and on CNN. They attracted news coverage, which amplified awareness about, attributed influence to, and enhanced their effects. This attention increased even more when the Clintons made a parody version of the ad. By framing the administration’s proposal in terms of high cost and big government, the ads contributed to its defeat in Congress. It would not be until 2010 that reform of health care would be achieved, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="paletz_1.0-ch16#paletz_1.0-ch16">Chapter 16 "Policymaking and Domestic Policies"</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Attracting Media Attention</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p01">Most interest groups do not engage in advocacy campaigns. Indeed, they lack sufficient funds to advertise at all. Yet coverage in the news media is essential, especially for many public interest groups, if they are to recruit members, raise funds, improve their access to policymakers, and obtain public support for their objectives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_062">Kay Lehman Schlozman and John T. Tierney, <em class="emphasis">Organized Interests and American Democracy</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1986), chap. 10; also Ken Kollman, <em class="emphasis">Outside Lobbying: Public Opinion &amp; Interest Group Strategies</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998).</span> So they hold news conferences, issue press releases, release research studies, give interviews to journalists, and try to have their spokespeople appear on talk radio and television public affairs shows. Their problem is that there are far more groups seeking news coverage than the media can or do accommodate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p02">Interest groups deploy several techniques to attract media coverage. Among them are the catchy phrase, the telling statistic, the scorecard, and the poll. Charlton Heston embodied the catchy phrase. While he was president and spokesperson of the National Rifle Association (NRA), he held up a musket during its annual meeting and told members that the only way he would give up his gun is when they pry it “from my cold dead hands.”</p>
            <div class="figure large small-height editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_f01">

                <p class="para">As its president, this hero of some of Hollywood’s greatest epics brought the NRA even more prominence, especially when he uttered his defiant phrase.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p03">This media-attention-getting phrase became his trademark, which he repeated with other guns at subsequent conventions. They were the last words he uttered before he officially stepped down from the NRA’s presidency in 2003.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p04">Another technique is the telling statistic. A report titled <em class="emphasis">City Slickers: How Farm Subsidy Checks End Up in Big Cities</em> from the Environmental Working Group achieved widespread and prominent publicity when it revealed that $1.2 million per year in agricultural subsidies was going to people living in the 90210 zip code, which is, as most Americans know from the television show of the same name, urban and affluent Beverly Hills.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_063">Ken Cook, Clark Williams, Andrew Art, and Chris Campbell, <em class="emphasis">City Slickers: How Farm Subsidy Checks End Up in Big Cities</em>, March 1995, accessed April 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/slickers">http://www.ewg.org/reports/slickers</a>.</span> Because farm subsidies are traditionally justified as preserving and protecting family farms, the report persuasively reframed the issue as government subsidies of wealthy corporate farm interests.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_064">Jeffrey M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p06">Some interest groups issue scorecards that enable journalists easily to report how policymakers have voted on issues of concern to the group’s members and the public. The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lcv.org">League of Conservation Voters</a> has released a list to the press during election years of the “Dirty Dozen” members of Congress with the supposedly worst records on the environment. The legislators targeted are usually in close races and some 60 percent of them have been defeated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p07">Interest groups also pay for or conduct public opinion polls, sometimes with questions that frame the issue to push the public toward their point of view. During the California water shortage of 2001, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfbf.com">California Farm Bureau</a> released a poll showing that 71 percent of those polled believed “that the federal government has a financial responsibility to help keep California’s farmers in agriculture production.” The actual question asked about “California family farmers” (the word “family” encouraged a positive response), the phrase “financial responsibility” is quite vague, and the 71 percent figure was achieved by adding the 44 percent “definite yes” response to the 27 percent “probably yes” response.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_065">California Farm Bureau Federation, “Farm leader calls for Federal action on farm crisis,” May 8, 2001.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p01">Most news coverage of societal and public interest groups goes only to a few. According to an article by Lucig H. Danielian and Benjamin Page, “The media seize upon a few prominent individuals or groups to speak for broad sets of interests.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_066">Lucig H. Danielian and Benjamin Page, “The Heavenly Chorus: Interest Group Voices on TV News,” <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Political Science</em> 38, no. 4 (November 1994): 1069.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p02">Witness a study of 244 interest groups in fourteen major newspapers, two news magazines, and the top three television networks.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_067">A. Trevor Thrall, “The Myth of the Outside Strategy: Mass Media News Coverage of Interest Groups,” <em class="emphasis">Political Communication</em> 23, no. 4 (2006): 407–20.</span> The single most-covered group in each of four policy areas received around 40 percent of all the coverage in that area. These were the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sierraclub.org">Sierra Club</a> on the environment, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfr.org">Council on Foreign Relations</a> on national security and foreign policy, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) for civil rights, and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cc.org">Christian Coalition of America</a> on broad matters of public policy. The figure reaches approximately 68 percent when the number of groups is raised to twelve (5 percent of the total number) to include the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.naacp.org">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en">Greenpeace</a>, and a few others. In contrast, 34 percent of the interest groups did not appear in a single story.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p03">The larger a group’s budget, the more likely it is to be covered. These groups have staff to communicate with the media, hold regular press conferences, provide the press with dependable information, stage events with dramatic visuals and symbolism, and make news by suing the government. They also are covered because reporters return repeatedly to sources that are familiar to them and their audiences.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p04">Most news organizations are not inclined to incur the expense of investigating interest groups’ organization and claims of accomplishments. Nor are they able to obtain easy access to the groups’ records. For ten years, the Christian Coalition was the most prominent interest group of the religious right. Journalists took the claims of its leaders at face value. Only later did former national leaders who had left the group reveal to the press that the number of members had been inflated.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_068">Laurie Goodstein, “Debt and Leadership Turmoil Sap Christian Coalition’s Political Strengths,” <em class="emphasis">International Herald Tribune</em>, August 3, 1999, 3.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Media Consequences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p01">Media depictions matter. Favorable coverage of public interest groups seeking to protect the environment and consumers has helped get their issues on the policy agenda and some of their proposals enacted.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_069">Jeffrey M. Berry, <em class="emphasis">The New Liberalism: The Rising Power of Citizen Groups</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 2000).</span> The breast cancer lobby is far more successful at shaping media coverage and thus influencing public opinion and determining public policy (including government funding) than the prostate cancer lobby, even though the diseases have almost identical morbidity and mortality rates.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_070">Karen M. Kedrowski and Marilyn Stine Sarow, <em class="emphasis">Cancer Activism: Gender, Media, and Public Policy</em> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Disproportionate coverage of a few societal and public interest groups enhances their importance and the impression that each one represents a policy area. Instead, there is often a spectrum of interest groups across areas. Sparse or nonexistent coverage of these interest groups means that the media do not bring their demands, activities, and policy perspectives to the attention of policymakers and the public.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p03">Unfavorable media depictions of labor unions reinforce their negative stereotypes. This coverage reduces public support for unions’ organizing efforts and discourages people from voluntarily joining unions. It discredits striking as a desirable or even appropriate way for unions to achieve their objectives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p04">Media coverage of business interest groups conveys their power. It limits this power by framing it as excessive and adverse to the public interest and by exposing some of it as greed and exploitation. This coverage affects public opinion. Of the people polled about “the power of different groups in influencing government policy, politicians, and policymakers in Washington” and which groups had “too much” influence, 86 percent selected “big companies,” 83 percent chose “political action committees which give money to political candidates,” and 71 percent picked “political lobbyists.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_071">The Harris Poll, April 26–May 5, 2001.</span> Overwhelmingly, people have the impression that government is run by a few big interests.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn09_072">1995 poll cited in Jeffrey M. Berry and Clyde Wilcox, <em class="emphasis">The Interest Group Society</em>, 3rd. ed. (New York: Longman, 2008), 19.</span> In November 2005, 90 percent of respondents to a Harris poll (up from 83 percent the previous year) said big companies had too much influence on government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p05">No wonder interest groups become issues in elections. Each party accuses the other of being beholden to “special interests” and of unsavory relationships with lobbyists. The media pursue stories about interest group contributions and of lobbyists holding prominent staff positions in candidates’ campaigns. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama refused in the 2008 presidential election to accept contributions from registered lobbyists and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">political action committees (PACs)</a><span class="glossdef">Organizations for raising and contributing campaign funds.</span></span>. Republican nominee John McCain established a conflict-of-interest policy that resulted in the resignation or dismissal of several members of his campaign staff who were registered as lobbyists.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p06">Interest groups use a variety of techniques to interact with the news media and obtain favorable coverage. These include advertising, public relations, and advocacy. Despite the vast number of interest groups in existence, the news media tend to cover the activities of only a few leading organizations. Media depictions of interest groups can have a significant impact on public opinion about them and support for or opposition to their policy preferences. The media often depict big business groups negatively, while they usually portray other groups such as environmental organizations more positively. The overall effect of the media’s depictions of interest groups is to give people the impression that government is run by a few big interests.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p07">Forming an interest group and keeping it going takes a strong commitment, but many young people have done just that. They recognize that there is power in numbers and that having a group of people unite behind a cause can be more effective than acting alone. Enterprising young people have established interest groups representing a wide range of causes and issues.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p08">An example of a youth-focused interest group is the Student Association for Voter Empowerment (SAVE), a national organization of college students whose mission is to promote civic education in order to increase voter participation and help young people navigate the public policy process and interact with government. In addition to voter advocacy, SAVE lobbies government officials to pass legislation promoting jobs, health insurance, and college financial aid for young people. SAVE was founded by Kenyon College graduates Matthew Segal and Anna Salzberg and has over ten thousand members on campuses in fifteen states. The organization makes use of online media to facilitate its operations. Students wishing to start a chapter of SAVE on their campus can access on online tool kit with directions for creating a constitution, building an organization, and becoming active. The organization provides information about key issues, advertises its activities, including conferences and outreach projects, facilitates communication among its members, and fundraises through its <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.genv.net/en-us/team/save_student_association_for_voter_empowerment">website</a>. Group leaders also publish a blog on the <em class="emphasis">Huffington Post</em>. SAVE was instrumental in getting the House of Representatives to introduce the bipartisan Student Voter Opportunity to Encourage Registration (VOTER) Act of 2008, which requires colleges to take measures to register students to vote.</p>
