    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_p02">The American legal system handles a vast number of disputes and controversies. Our concern in this text is with civil and criminal cases, the main ways by which courts wield power and influence and make policy.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_003">Patricia Ewick and Susan S. Silbey, <em class="emphasis">The Common Place of Law</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), 18–19.</span></p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Civil Cases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p01">In civil cases, plaintiffs (people or organizations) initiate lawsuits against defendants; courts resolve disputes by deciding or mediating between the two sides. Civil cases can involve money, contracts, property, personal injury, divorce, or child custody. “I’ll sue you” is a threat to instigate a civil action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p02">The vast majority of civil cases, some seventeen million annually, are filed in state courts, compared to around four hundred thousand in federal courts. State and federal laws establish the type of civil cases their courts can hear. For example, because there is no federal divorce law, all divorce cases are heard in state courts; because Social Security is a federal program, all civil disputes involving it are heard in federal courts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p03">Because of their costs and the often lengthy delays until they are heard in court, only about 1.3 percent of civil suits filed go to trial. Most civil cases are resolved by other means, such as settlements, plea deals, mediation, or arbitration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Criminal Cases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p01">Criminal cases are initiated by the government. They run the gamut from misdemeanors, such as trespassing and disorderly conduct, to felonies, such as armed robbery, rape, and murder. Unlike civil cases, criminal cases can result in the loss of liberty: a jail sentence. Around seven million people in the United States are either in prison, on probation, or on parole for crimes committed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p02">Most criminal laws are passed by states, and the vast majority of criminal cases originate in state courts: roughly twenty-one million criminal cases annually, compared to about seventy-six thousand in federal courts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p03">Around 27 percent of the criminal cases heard in federal courts involve alleged violations of federal drug laws. Often requiring mandatory sentences without parole, these federal laws are much tougher than state laws, so it makes an enormous difference whether a drug offense case is tried in a federal or state court.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p04">Only about 4 percent of criminal cases are decided by trial. Prosecutors drop, or do not continue with charges, on another 25 percent. Most of the rest are resolved by guilty pleas without going to trial. Even for murder or manslaughter, a majority of defendants plead guilty. This often entails a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plea bargain</a><span class="glossdef">Agreement whereby a defendant agrees to plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence, a reduced charge, or both.</span></span>, in which defendants plead guilty in exchange for a reduced charge. The judge must approve the plea bargain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p05">Except for affluent defendants with high-powered and well-paid attorneys, people involved in criminal cases have an incentive to plea bargain. Defendants who insist on going to trial face sentences that can be far longer than those received by defendants who plead guilty and cooperate with the government. For lawyers and judges, plea bargains save both time and trial costs and also lighten their workloads. Because so many plead guilty, forty-seven million Americans have criminal records.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_004">Amy Beach, <em class="emphasis">Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court</em> (New York: Metropolitan, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p01">Dubbed “tabloid justice,” news depictions of the criminal justice system, especially on cable television, focus on dramatic, sensational, and lurid cases.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_005">Richard L. Fox, Robert W. Van Sickel, and Thomas L. Steiger, <em class="emphasis">Tabloid Justice: Criminal Justice in an Age of Media Frenzy</em>, 2nd ed. (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2007).</span> A notorious instance was the Duke University lacrosse team rape story, which provoked a prodigious amount of often erroneous news coverage as well as outrageous opinions and judgments (notoriously from television commentator Nancy Grace) from March 2006 until April 2007, when all charges against the students were dropped and the case dismissed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p02">The types of cases receiving excessive and inflammatory coverage include those of a basketball star (Kobe Bryant) charged with rape; an actor (Robert Blake) accused of killing his wife; a decorating diva (Martha Stewart) charged with lying to the FBI; a pop star (Michael Jackson) accused of molesting children; and a mother (Casey Anthony) accused of killing her daughter. The media want, as the chief executive of truTV (formerly Court TV) put it, “the type of trials that have all the melodrama of a soap opera.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_006">Quoted in Lola Ogunnaike, “As Court TV Gets Even Bolder, So Does Its Star,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 2, 2004, B1.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p03">Even trials covered live on television may be unrealistic examples of how the US criminal justice system operates. The trial of O. J. Simpson, accused of the murder of his ex-wife and a friend of hers, attracted huge attention from the news media and the public during the mid-1990s. Simpson was a celebrity defendant with sufficient wealth to hire a cast of attorneys and undergo a lengthy trial. In reality, most criminal trials take little time. The Los Angeles Superior Court disposed of nearly fifty-two thousand cases between the time of Simpson’s arrest and his acquittal.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_007">“Simpson Trial and Trivia,” <em class="emphasis">US News &amp; World Report</em>, October 15, 1995, 43.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p04">Trials are a staple of entertainment drama.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_008">See Timothy O. Lenz, <em class="emphasis">Changing Images of Law in Film &amp; Television Crime Stories</em> (New York: Peter Lang, 2003); and Anthony Chase, <em class="emphasis">Movies on Trial: The Legal System on the Silver Screen</em> (New York: New Press, 2002).</span> Many television series and their spin-offs involve trials. These shows differ drastically from the reality of courts and trials through the addition of drama and emotion: the highlights of cross-examination, attorneys browbeating witnesses and making speeches, and the guilty confessing. They rarely contain procedural elements, and the issues of “jurisdiction, notices to defendants, pleadings, discovery, and choice of a judge or jury trial, all of which can be argued, replied to, and motioned against.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_009">Wende Vyborney Dumble, “And Justice for All,” in <em class="emphasis">Television Studies</em>, ed. Gary Burns and Robert J. Thompson (Westport, CT: Praeger, 1989), 106.</span> As David E. Kelley, creator of <em class="emphasis">The Practice</em> and a former lawyer said, “I am writing the world of law in the way I would like it to be. It’s all a conceit, because most trials are boring.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_010">Thane Rosenbaum, “Where Lawyers with a Conscience Get to Win Cases,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 12, 2002, AR 23.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p05">Relatedly, trial judges are usually portrayed on television as legitimate and judicious, and their decisions almost always as correct. Consider the pseudorealistic television courtroom shows represented by <em class="emphasis">Judge Judy</em> and <em class="emphasis">Judge Joe Brown</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p06">The prevalence of courtroom shows is a testament to their appeal and to television’s need for cheap and relatively easy-to-produce programming. Frequent viewers believe that judges should—as these “judges” do—ask questions, be aggressive with litigants, express views about their testimony, and make known their opinions about the outcome of the cases.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_011">Kimberlianne Podlas, “Should We Blame Judge Judy? The Messages TV Courtrooms send Viewers,” <em class="emphasis">Judicature</em> 86, no. 1 (July–August 2002): 38–43.</span> This is, in fact, the opposite of how most real judges behave.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Federal District and Appeals Courts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p01">There are 94 federal district courts staffed by 667 permanent and several temporary judges. Every state has at least one district with a district court in it responsible for hearing cases that arise within that geographic area.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p02">Above the district courts are the federal courts of appeal. They decide whether or not district courts have made an error in conducting a trial. Judges on appeal courts base their rulings on written and oral legal arguments presented by lawyers for each side. There are no witnesses, no testimony, and no jury. Appellate courts answer questions of law rather than questions of fact.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p03">There are currently thirteen courts of appeals, twelve of them based on geographic districts called “circuits.” There are eleven numbered circuits, each of which has jurisdiction over several states. No state straddles more than one circuit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p04">There is a twelfth circuit for the District of Columbia (known as the “DC Circuit”). The thirteenth circuit is the court of appeals for the “Federal Circuit,” which hears appeals from US Courts of Federal Claims, International Trade, the Patent and Trademark Office, and others. There are approximately 179 judges on the courts of appeals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p05">A case in district court is usually presided over by one judge, whereas an appeal before a court of appeals is typically heard by a panel of three judges. A majority vote of the panel is necessary to overturn a lower-court ruling. The court of appeals issues a written ruling explaining its decision.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s01_p06">Every litigant in federal court has the right to appeal an unfavorable ruling from the district court. However, because it is expensive to appeal, only about 17 percent of eligible litigants do so. Moreover, higher courts hear few of the cases appealed and rarely reverse lower-court decisions.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_012">Donald R. Songer, Reginald S. Sheehan, and Susan B.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_s02_p02">The Constitution does not stipulate any specific qualifications, not even a minimum age or legal training, for Supreme Court justices and other federal judges.

        <h2 class="title editable block">How the US Supreme Court Works</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p01">Article III and the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution require that the Supreme Court be the first court to hear certain types of cases. This original jurisdiction is limited to cases</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>between the United States and one of the states,</li>
            <li>between two or more states,</li>
            <li>involving foreign ambassadors or other ministers,</li>
            <li>brought by one state against citizens of another state or against a foreign country.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p02">Only about 1 percent of the Supreme Court’s cases fall under its original jurisdiction. The rest reach it as appeals from civil and criminal cases that have been decided by lower federal and by state courts. As the highest appellate court in the nation, the Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter in many areas of the law.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p03">If the case involves a federal question, an appeal can be made from the state’s appellate court of last resort to the US Supreme Court. A federal question exists if a state law is alleged to violate federal law (an act of Congress), a treaty ratified by the US Senate, or the US Constitution; or because something that state officials do is claimed to violate the Constitution or federal law. Grounds for appeal include evidence gathered from an unreasonable search and seizure, a coerced confession, and infringement of a constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p04">With rare exceptions, the Supreme Court has absolute control over the appeals it chooses to hear. Of the roughly eight thousand cases appealed to the Court every year, the justices typically agree to review a few hundred.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p05">The justices normally decide around seventy of these with comprehensive written opinions during the Court’s annual term from October through late June to early July. The Court occasionally issues <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">per curiam decisions</a><span class="glossdef">Short, unsigned opinion by the Supreme Court, usually for cases it decides without oral argument.</span></span>: brief unsigned opinions, usually for cases it decides without oral argument.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_p06">The justices do not have to give any reasons for accepting or rejecting a case.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Writ of Certiorari</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_s01_p01">Most cases reach the Court by way of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">writ of certiorari</a><span class="glossdef">Petition asking the Supreme Court to review a case.</span></span>. <em class="emphasis">Certiorari</em> is Latin for “to make more certain.” Litigants who receive an adverse ruling in the federal appeals courts or, in cases involving a federal question, from a state’s highest appellate court can submit a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, asking it to review the case.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_s01_p02">It takes four of the nine justices to “grant cert.” This is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rule of Four</a><span class="glossdef">Rule stipulating that at least four justices of the Supreme Court must vote to accept an appealed case before it can be heard.</span></span>. If the Supreme Court does not grant cert, the lower court ruling is left standing. This does <em class="emphasis">not</em> mean that the Supreme Court agrees with that ruling, only that the Court has chosen not to review it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_s01_p03">When the Supreme Court grants cert, it is usually because four or more of the justices believe the case represents an important issue, such as an unresolved constitutional or statutory question on which they are interested in ruling. Sometimes disputes between different courts need to be resolved, or Congress and lower courts need the Court’s guidance on the Constitution. However, it is not unknown for justices to avoid granting cert to important cases because they do not want to rule on them.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn15_013">Lisa A.

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch15_s01_s04_s06_p06">Coverage of most criminal cases is decided by plea bargains. A few trials attract abundant coverage in news and entertainment media, which depict them unrealistically. The federal court system consists of ninety-four district courts, with at least one in each state, and thirteen appeals courts, each one with jurisdiction over several states. At the top of the judicial system is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s decisions entail briefs, oral arguments, conferences, clerks, and opinions.</p>
