        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p01">Latinos have displaced African Americans as the largest minority group in the United States. They are disproportionately foreign-born, young, and poor. They can keep in touch with issues and their community through a burgeoning Spanish-language media. Daily newspapers and national television networks, such as Univisión, provide a mix of news and advocacy.</p>

After Latino groups claimed that voting rights were at risk for citizens not literate in English, the Voting Rights Act was amended to require ballots to be available in a language other than English in election districts where that language was spoken by 5 percent or more of the electorate. And the Supreme Court has ruled that school districts violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when students are taught in a language that they do not understand.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_023"><em class="emphasis">Lau v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p04">In 2006, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) introduced legislation to change illegal immigration from a violation of civil law to a felony and to punish anyone who provided assistance to illegal immigrants, even church ministers. Hundreds of thousands rallied in cities across the country to voice their opposition. President George W. Bush pushed for a less punitive approach that would recognize illegal immigrants as “guest workers” but would still not allow them to become citizens.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Other politicians have proposed legislation. Mired in controversy, none of these proposals have become law. President Obama revisited one aspect of the subject in his 2011 State of the Union message:</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p07">Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Many landmark cases on racial discrimination going back to the nineteenth century stemmed from suits by Asian Americans. World War II brought more discrimination out of an unjustified, if not irrational, fear that some Japanese Americans might be loyal to Japan and thus commit acts of sabotage against the United States: the federal government imposed curfews on them. Then after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans (62 percent of them US citizens) were forcibly moved from their homes to distant, desolate relocation camps. Ruling toward the end of the war, the Supreme Court did not strike down the internment policy, but it did hold that classifying people by race is unconstitutional.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_026"><em class="emphasis">Korematsu v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Japanese Americans who had been interred in camps later pressed for redress.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p04">Asian Americans have united against discrimination. During the Vietnam era, Asian American students opposing the war highlighted its impact on Asian populations. Instead of slogans such as “Bring the GIs home,” they chanted, “Stop killing our Asian brothers and sisters.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p05">These Asian American student groups—and the periodicals they spawned—provided the foundation for a unified Asian American identity and politics.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_028">Yen Le Espiritu, <em class="emphasis">Asian American Panethnicity: Bridging Institutions and Identities</em> (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992), chap. 2; Pei-Te Lien, <em class="emphasis">The Making of Asian America Through Political Participation</em> (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001), chap. 5.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p06">A dazzling array of Asian American nationalities, religions, and cultures has emerged since 1965, after restrictions on immigration from Asia were removed.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Native Americans</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p01">Native Americans represent many tribes with distinct languages, cultures, and traditions. Nowadays, they obtain protection against discrimination just as members of other racial and ethnic groups do. Specifically, the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) of 1968 guaranteed them many civil rights, including equal protection under the law and due process; freedom of speech, press, and assembly; and protection from unreasonable search and seizure, self-incrimination, and double jeopardy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Native Americans’ civil rights issues today center on tribal autonomy and self-government on Indian reservations. Thus some of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as the separation of church and state, do not apply to tribes.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_030"><em class="emphasis">Talton v. Mayes</em>, 163 US 376 (1896).</span> Reservations may also legally discriminate in favor of hiring Native Americans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p03">For much of history, Native Americans residing outside of reservations were in a legal limbo, being neither members of self-governing tribal nations nor US citizens. For example, in 1881, John Elk, a Native American living in Omaha, claimed that he was denied equal protection of the laws when he was prevented from voting. The Supreme Court ruled that since he was “born to an Indian nation,” Elk was not a citizen and could not claim a right to vote.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_031"><em class="emphasis">Elk v. Wilkins</em>, 112 US 94 (1884).</span> Nowadays, Native Americans living on or outside reservations vote as any other citizens.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p02">Women’s activism arose in the campaign to abolish slavery. Women abolitionists argued that the case against slavery could not be made as long as women did not have political rights as well. In 1848, women and men active in the antislavery movement, meeting in Seneca Falls, New York, adopted a Declaration of Sentiments. Emulating the Declaration of Independence, it argued that “all men and women are created equal” and catalogued “repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_032">Nancy Isenberg, <em class="emphasis">Sex and Citizenship in Antebellum America</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998); Susan Zaeske, <em class="emphasis">Signatures of Citizenship: Petitioning, Antislavery, and Women’s Political Identity</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p03">Then came an unexpected breakthrough: Conservative Southern House members, hoping to slow down passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, offered what they deemed frivolous amendments—one of which expanded the act to protect women. Northern and Southern male legislators joined in derision and laughter. The small contingent of congresswomen berated their colleagues and allied with Southern conservatives to pass the amendment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p04">Thus the Civil Rights Act ended up also barring discrimination in employment on the basis of sex.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p05">In 1967, women activists reacted by forming the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.now.org">National Organization for Women</a> (NOW), which became the basis for a revived women’s movement. NOW’s first president was Betty Friedan, a freelance writer for women’s magazines.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s03_p01">By 1970, Democrats and Republicans alike backed the ERA and women’s rights.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s03_p02">Such laws could be far reaching. Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, outlawing sex discrimination in federally funded educational programs, prompted little debate when it was enacted. Today it is controversial. Some charge that it pushes funds to women’s sports, endangering men’s sports. Defenders respond that all of women’s sports put together get less funding at universities than men’s sports, such as basketball or football.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_039">Joyce Gelb and Marian Lief Palley, <em class="emphasis">Women and Public Policies: Reassessing Gender Politics</em>, rev. ed.

It passed by huge bipartisan margins in the House in 1970 and the Senate in 1972; thirty of the thirty-eight states necessary to ratify approved it almost immediately. However, opposition to the ERA, led and generated by conservative women, arose among the general public, including women. While women working outside the home generally favored the ERA to fight job discrimination, housewives feared that the ERA would remove protection for them, such as the legal presumptions that women were more eligible than men for alimony after a divorce. The public’s support of the ERA declined because of fears that it might allow military conscription of women and gay marriage. The political consensus crumbled, and in 1980, the Republican platform opposed ERA for the first time. ERA died in 1982 when the ratification process expired.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_040">Jane S.

In a postelection press conference, Clinton said he would sign an executive order to do so. The news media, seeing a dramatic and clear-cut story, kept after this issue, which became the top concern of Clinton’s first days in office. The military and key members of Congress launched a public relations campaign against Clinton’s stand, highlighted by a media event at which legislators toured cramped submarines and asked sailors on board how they felt about serving with gay people. Clinton ultimately supported a compromise that was closer to a surrender—a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that has had the effect of substantially increasing the number of discharges from the military for homosexuality.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn05_052">Craig A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p01">Same-sex couples brought suits in state courts on the grounds that preventing them from marrying was sex discrimination barred by their state constitutions. In 1996, Hawaii’s state supreme court agreed. Many members of Congress, concerned that officials might be forced by the Constitution’s “full faith and credit” clause to recognize same-sex marriages from Hawaii, quickly passed a Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed. It defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman and denies same-sex couples federal benefits for married people. Many states followed suit, and Hawaii’s court decision was nullified when the state’s voters amended the state constitution before it could take effect.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_s04_p02">In 2000, the highest state court in Vermont ruled that the state may not discriminate against same-sex couples and allowed the legislature to create <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil unions</a><span class="glossdef">Alternative to same-sex marriage, whereby a state does not allow same-sex couples to legally marry but allows them to apply for legal recognition of their relationship; this gives them the rights and privileges of marriage in that state.</span></span>.

                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch05_s02_s06_s02_p05">In this section, we addressed the civil rights challenges facing Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, as well as women, lesbians and gays, and individuals with disabilities. Latinos have gained language but not immigration rights. After the horror of relocation inflicted on Japanese Americans, Asian Americans have obtained their rights, although vestiges of discrimination remain. Rights issues for Native Americans concern tribal autonomy and self-government. Women have gained less civil rights protection, in part because of policy disagreements among women and because of fear of undermining men’s and women’s traditional roles. Gay people have won protections against discrimination in states and localities and through the courts, but have been denied equality in marriage. People with disabilities have won civil rights protections through national legislative and executive action.</p>
