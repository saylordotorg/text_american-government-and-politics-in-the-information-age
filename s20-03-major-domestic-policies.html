    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_p02">We now describe the development and current condition of four of the federal government’s main domestic policies: welfare, social security, education, and health care.</p>
    <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Welfare Policies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_p01">The services and benefits governments provide through their social policies vary widely. Scandinavian countries, such as Norway, establish a safety net from the cradle to the grave. Americans rely more on employment and private sources (insurance policies) than the government for their income and to protect them against economic misfortune.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_p02">For some American policymakers, poverty stems in part from the failure of the economic system to provide enough jobs at a living wage and from racism and sexism. They support policies to alleviate poverty’s causes (e.g., increasing the minimum wage or lengthening the period of unemployment compensation). From this perspective, people are not much to blame for needing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public assistance (welfare)</a><span class="glossdef">Government aid to those in need.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_p03">An alternative view blames people for their fate. Public assistance violates the American values of individual enterprise and responsibility. It is believed that recipients would rather collect government handouts than work. No wonder welfare is one of the most reviled social programs. It is often given grudgingly and with stringent conditions attached.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s01_p01">Title IV of the Social Security Act of 1935 provided funds for the states to help the destitute elderly, the blind, and children. Its primary purpose was to assist poverty-stricken families with children during the heart of the Great Depression. Over time, it became <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/abbrev/afdc-tanf.htm">Aid to Families with Dependent Children</a> (AFDC), granting financial assistance to low-income mothers and their children.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_018">Michael B. Katz, <em class="emphasis">In the Shadow of the Poorhouse: A Social History of Welfare in the United States</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1997).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s01_p02">With expansion came criticisms, often conveyed and amplified by the media. The program was seen as supporting “unwed motherhood, idleness, and dishonesty.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_019">Christopher Jencks, “What Happened to Welfare?” <em class="emphasis">New York Review</em>, December 15, 2005, 74.</span> It was disparaged for providing aid to individuals without requiring anything in return. Families were given levels of assistance on the basis of their size: the more children families had, the more aid they received. Women were deterred from attempting to leave welfare by getting jobs because they were limited in the number of hours they could work without losing some of their benefits.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Welfare Policies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s02_p01">In his successful 1991 campaign for the presidency, Bill Clinton preempted what had been a Republican issue by promising to “put an end to welfare as we know it.” In 1996, after rejecting previous versions, he signed a Republican bill, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). This helped him get reelected in 1996.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s02_p02">This law replaced AFDC with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. The federal government gives states grants in aid and greater autonomy in structuring their welfare systems if they follow rules. Adult welfare recipients are limited to a lifetime total of five years of TANF benefits. State governments lose some of their TANF funding unless they show that significant numbers of their welfare recipients are entering the workforce. To receive benefits, children under eighteen must live with their parents or in an adult-supervised setting.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s02_p04">Since the law was passed, some states have reported decreases of over 50 percent in their number of welfare recipients. However it remains to be seen if the changes in welfare policy have led to less poverty or simply removed people from the welfare rolls<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_020">“Welfare Reform: With TANF Flexibility, States Vary in How They Implement Work” (Washington, DC: General Accounting Office, 2002), accessed June 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02770.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02770.pdf</a>.</span> and what the effects of the policy are now that the economy has declined and people who had moved from welfare to employment have lost their jobs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s01_s02_p05">The federal government does pay the cost of food stamps. Nearly one in seven Americans receives them, with an average benefit of $500 a month for a family of four. Removing the stigma of welfare from the stamps, the government changed the program’s name to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance. Making it even more acceptable, it is supported by farmers and grocery stores.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_021">Jason DeParle and Robert Gebeloff, “The Safety Net: Across U.S., Food Stamp Use Soars and Stigma Fades,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 8, 2009, accessed June 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/us/29foodstamps">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/us/29foodstamps</a>; and Jason DeParle and Robert Gebeloff, “Once Stigmatized, Food Stamps Find New Users and Acceptance,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 11, 2010, A1.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_p04">It established a system of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Government invests individuals’ mandatory payroll deductions in a trust fund to be distributed according to specific criteria (e.g., age).</span></span> in which taxes on payrolls were used to provide benefits to the elderly. Social Security was soon expanded to cover benefits for “survivors,” including widows, dependent children, and orphans. In 1956, disabled Americans were added to the list of beneficiaries, thus formally creating the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) system.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_022">For an overview of the origin of the Social Security System, see Edward D. Berkowitz, <em class="emphasis">Robert Ball and the Politics of Social Security</em> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003).</span> In 1972, benefit levels were tied to the consumer price index—benefit levels go up when the consumer price index does.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_p05">Social Security now provides benefits to over forty-eight million Americans. It is the main source of economic survival for two-thirds of the elderly and the only source of income for over 30 percent of the aged.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Social Security’s Solvency</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s01_p01">Traditionally, more money has been paid into the Social Security Trust Fund than drawn out, leading to a revenue surplus. But Americans are living longer than ever. Longer lives mean larger payouts from the fund, as there is no limit on the number of years people receive benefits. Also, recent generations entering the workforce are generally smaller in size than their predecessors. By 2040, there will not be enough money in the fund to finance recipients at the current level.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_023">For a contrary view, see Joseph White, <em class="emphasis">False Alarm: Why the Greatest Threat to Social Security and Medicare Is the Campaign to “Save” Them</em> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s01_p02">Special commissions have issued reports, prominently covered with alarmist stories by the press, about these problems. Proposals to “fix” Social Security have been developed by these commissions, think tanks, other interest groups, and a few politicians. Policymakers are wary of suggesting that they may tamper with the revered system; they make change with delicacy. Thus in 1983, the age of eligibility for full retirement benefits was increased from 65 to 66, but the change wasn’t effective until 2009; the age increases to 67 in 2027.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s01_p03">Additional revenue could be generated by increasing the percentage of the payroll tax or the amount to which it is applied on employees’ wages and employers’ contributions. However, tax increases are never popular among elected officials, so these options lack advocates in Congress.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">President Bush’s Proposals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p01">Thinking to trade on the momentum of his 2004 reelection, President George W. Bush went public with a campaign to inspire public and congressional support for his proposals to “save” Social Security.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_024">For details of President Bush’s campaign, see George C. Edwards III, <em class="emphasis">Governing by Campaigning: The Politics of the Bush Presidency</em> (New York: Longman, 2007), 216–80.</span> Launching his campaign in his State of the Union address, he embarked on a high-profile “60 Cities in 60 Days” tour. His theme: Social Security was in perilous condition. He proposed to save it through personal (private) savings accounts. People would be allowed to invest a third of their Social Security withholdings into a variety of investment options such as the stock market.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p02">The argument for privatization is that the stock market greatly outperforms Social Security’s trust fund over the long term.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_025">The Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, has been a major proponent of privatization. Its recommendations can be found at Cato Institute, “Social Security,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.org">http://www.socialsecurity.org</a>.</span> Over time, therefore, privatized investment would be a boon to the overall size of the trust fund and protect the solvency of the system.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p03">The president appeared at town hall meetings with handpicked, sympathetic audiences. Signs saying “Protecting our Seniors” flanked him. He used the positive and evocative words “choice” and “ownership” to describe his proposals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p04">President Bush was supported by such powerful interest groups as the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://businessroundtable.org/">Business Roundtable</a>. He also received support from potential beneficiaries of his proposed changes: Wall Street firms would receive billions of dollars to manage personal accounts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p05">The president faced opposition from Democrats and powerful interest groups such as organized labor and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aarp.org/">AARP</a> (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons). They were bolstered by experts in Social Security policy who provided information challenging and undermining Bush’s arguments and claims.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p06">Critics of the president’s proposals argued that there was no crisis; that the stock market goes down as well as up, so investing in it is risky and people could end up with reduced retirement income; and that private investment accounts would require the government to borrow about $2 trillion to offset the reduction in payroll taxes to avoid a shortfall in payments owed to current retirees. Most dramatically, the president’s opponents contended that his proposals would destroy the program.</p>

        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s03">

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s03_p01">It was a perfect setup for the news media. On one side were the president and his nationwide campaign; on the other side was the opposition. Experts could be called on to assess the validity of both sides’ arguments. This was all done on a policy issue—the future of Social Security—of public interest and concern.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s03_p02">From the start, media coverage undermined the president. The very first story in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><em class="emphasis">New York Times</em></a> set the pattern. It was headlined “As White House Begins Campaign for Overhauling Social Security, Critics Claim Exaggeration.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_026">Edmund L. Andrews, “As White House Begins Campaign for Overhauling Social Security, Critics Claim Exaggeration,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 10, 2005, A15.</span> It cited “outside analysts,” including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and academics casting doubt on the president’s arguments. It contained this devastating paragraph: “White House officials privately concede that the centrepiece of Mr. Bush’s approach to Social Security—letting people invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts—would do nothing in itself to eliminate the long-term gap.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s03_p03">Perhaps because there was no new news in the president’s appearances and statements, stories reporting them focused on the rigged audiences, the “carefully screened panelists,” and “meticulously staged “conversations.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_027">Jim VandeHei and Peter Baker, “Social Security: On with the Show: President’s ‘Conversations’ on Issue Are Carefully Orchestrated, Rehearsed,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, March 12, 2005, A3.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s02_s03_p04">The more the president spoke, the less the public supported his proposals. From early January into May 2005, public opinion about the way Bush was handling Social Security decreased from 41 to 31 percent approval, and disapproval increased from 52 to 64 percent.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_028">Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll, January and May 2005.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_p01">Traditionally, education policy has been the domain of state and local governments.

The 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) allotted funds for developing remedial programs, hiring teachers and aides, and purchasing supplies and equipment. The Head Start Program, also established in 1965, provided low-income children with preschool education. The Department of Education was created in 1979.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_s02_p01">President Obama’s Secretary of Education <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ed.gov/">Arne Duncan</a> promised to rectify the defects of NCLB. He embraced competition, accountability, parental choice, and incentives. Specifically, he proposed to raise academic standards, end the misleading identification of thousands of schools as failing, turn around schools that were truly failing, recruit and retain effective teachers, track students’ and teachers’ performance, and tie teacher evaluation to students’ test scores. He wanted to increase the number of charter schools—a broad term describing the more than five thousand private schools set up mainly in urban areas, with local and state and private funds, to compete with public schools.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_035">Carlo Rotella, “Class Warrior,” <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em>, February 1, 2010, 24–29.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_s02_p02">Duncan encouraged the development of national standards in English and math to be adopted by the states, specifying the skills students should have at each grade level. Although the timetable for implementing the standards is uncertain, states will have to rethink teacher training, textbooks, and testing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_s02_p03">Duncan also created the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">Race to the Top</a> competition allocating $4.3 billion in education aid to states that comply with the administration’s educational goals. But this is a modest sum, won by only a few states, compared with the approximately $650 billion spent on K–12 education annually.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_s02_p04">At the same time, states and localities beset by budget deficits are slashing their expenditures for education. They are doing this by dismissing teachers, hiring few new ones, increasing class sizes, and cutting programs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s03_s02_p05">So even though the federal government is now far more involved in education than ever before, it prods but cannot compel the states and localities to do its bidding. Moreover, some states and school districts still object to federal intrusion and mandates. Besides, the quality of education often depends more on a student’s family and community than the schools, starting with whether children are healthy enough to learn.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_p01">Program by program, the federal government has contributed to the costs of medical care for some of the people who have difficulty paying their medical bills or have no health insurance. The media encouraged the creation of such government policies by consistently reporting about the large number of uninsured Americans who, it was assumed, were without adequate doctor, prescription drug, and hospital care.</p>

There are no limits on the total costs people can incur.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s01_p03">Part B is an optional insurance system covering health-care costs outside of hospital stays for physician services, medical tests, and outpatient visits.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s03_p04">Because of the high cost of health-care services covered under Medicaid, state governments have become increasingly burdened financially.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s04_p01">Around fifty-one million Americans lacked health insurance. This figure included approximately nine million under the age of eighteen who were eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Some twenty-eight million people came from households with income above the poverty line but whose employers did not provide them with health insurance. Their work was often temporary or part time and low-paid. About fifteen million of the uninsured had income below the poverty line yet were not receiving Medicaid.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s04_p02">Politicians proposed policies in response to the lack of health care. Most notably, the Clinton administration, led by First Lady Hillary Clinton, proposed health-care coverage for all United States citizens. This 1994 initiative died for lack of support in Congress, in part because of its complexity and a negative advertising campaign by interest groups against it.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_037">Jacob S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p01">After he assumed office in 2009, President Obama took up health care as a major policy initiative. His administration negotiated (i.e., bargained) with every major sector of the health-care industry to support its health-care proposals. Motivating the industry was the drop in the number of employers insuring their employees or providing generous coverage and the number of employees who could afford to pay their share of the cost of insurance. This resulted in fewer Americans with insurance coverage and thus able to pay for hospital care, doctors, and drugs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p02">At the heart of the bargain “was a simple quid quo pro: accept greater public regulation and involvement in return for greater guaranteed financing.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_038">Jacob S. Hacker, “The Road to Somewhere: Why Health Reform Happened,” <em class="emphasis">Perspectives on Politics</em> 8, no. 3 (September 2010): 865.</span> That is, the government would require people to have insurance, thereby greatly expanding the market. This bargain did not prevent each industry group from lobbying to modify or scuttle provisions in the legislation that might reduce its members’ income. The drug industry opposed studying the effectiveness of treatment; the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association</a> lobbied to kill the proposal for a government-run insurer (i.e., the public option); hospital lobbyists objected to a Medicare oversight board that could reduce payments.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn16_039">David D. Kirkpatrick, “Groups Back Health Overhaul, but Seek Cover,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, September 12, 2009, A1.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p03">In March 2010, the Democratic majority in Congress passed the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/introduction/index.html">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a>, arguably the most important domestic legislation in decades. It passed without a single Republican vote and despite millions of dollars of advertising aimed at the forty Democrats in the House deemed vulnerable to defeat if they voted for the bill. In this instance, party loyalty, appeals from party leaders (especially the president), advertisements from supporters of the legislation, and the realization that this was the most propitious opportunity to enact health reform in many years overcame the opponents’ arguments and advertising.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p04">The law is complicated; many provisions do not go into effect until 2014 or later. Bureaucrats will have to write the thousands of pages of rules, define terms such as “benefits,” and clarify the details. States will have to implement many provisions. Lobbying will be intense. The Republican majority in the House of Representative voted in 2011 to repeal the law and is likely to strip away funds for putting the law into effect. The law’s constitutionality has been challenged in court—cases that, probably consolidated, will likely reach the US Supreme Court.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p05">If it remains in effect, the law will eventually provide health insurance for around thirty-two million uninsured Americans. It will expand eligibility and subsidize lower premiums for Medicaid, transforming it from a government health-insurance program just for poor families into a much wider program to include millions of the poorest Americans, including able-bodied adults under sixty-five who earn no more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. People not covered by their employers and who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid can buy coverage from state-based insurance purchasing organizations. The law prohibits insurance companies from rejecting people for preexisting medical conditions, removes annual and lifetime limits on payments by insurance companies, and enables children to stay on their parents’ policy until they turn twenty-six.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch16_s03_s04_s05_p06">Such a complicated law raises a host of criticisms and questions. Are its costs affordable? Can Medicaid absorb the additional people, especially when—even now—many doctors do not accept Medicaid patients on the grounds that the reimbursement it pays is too low? Will insurance premiums continue to rise substantially? Is it constitutional to fine people who remain uninsured? Can the law curb unnecessary care (whatever “unnecessary” means in practice)?</p>
