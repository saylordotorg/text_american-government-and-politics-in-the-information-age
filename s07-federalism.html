        <h2 class="title editable block">Preamble</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s00_p01">The war in Iraq was dragging on long past President George W. Bush’s declaration in May 2003 of the end of formal hostilities. In 2004, the Defense Department, wary of the political pain of reviving the military draft, called up most of the National Guard. The Guard consists of volunteers for state military units headed by the state’s governor but answerable to the commander in chief, the president. Most Guard volunteers expect to serve and keep the peace at home in their states, not fight in a war overseas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s00_p02">State and local governments made it known that they were being adversely affected by the war. At the 2004 annual meeting of the National Governors Association, governors from both political parties fretted that the call-up had slashed the numbers of the National Guard available for states’ needs by as much as 60 percent. Their concerns made the front page of the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>. The story began, “Many of the nation’s governors complained…that they were facing severe manpower shortages in guarding prisoners, fighting wildfires, preparing for hurricanes and floods and policing the streets.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_001">Sarah Kershaw, “Governors Tell of War’s Impact on Local Needs,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 20, 2004, A1.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_s02_p03">Since the Constitution gives Congress and the national government exclusive “power to regulate commerce…with the Indian tribes,” states have no automatic authority over tribe members on reservations within state borders.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_011"><em class="emphasis">Worcester v.

The US Constitution specifies exclusive and concurrent powers for the national and state governments. Other powers are implied and determined by day-to-day politics.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">The meaning of federalism has changed over time. During the first decades of the republic, many politicians held that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">states’ rights</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that holds that each state entered into a compact in ratifying the Constitution and can therefore decide whether or not to obey a law it considers unconstitutional.</span></span> allowed states to disobey any national government that in their view exceeded its powers. Such a doctrine was largely discredited after the Civil War. Then <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dual federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that divides power between national and state governments into distinct, clearly demarcated domains of authority.</span></span>, a clear division of labor between national and state government, became the dominant doctrine. During the New Deal of the 1930s, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cooperative federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that sees national, state, and local governments working together to address problems and implement public policies in numerous domains.</span></span>, whereby federal and state governments work together to solve problems, emerged and held sway until the 1960s. Since then, the situation is summarized by the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">competitive federalism</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to federalism that stresses the conflict and compromise between national, state, and local governments.</span></span>, whereby responsibilities are assigned based on whether the national government or the state is thought to be best able to handle the task.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">States’ Rights</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">The ink had barely dried on the Constitution when disputes arose over federalism. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton hoped to build a strong national economic system; Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson favored a limited national government. Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian factions in President George Washington’s cabinet led to the first political parties: respectively, the Federalists, who favored national supremacy, and the Republicans, who supported states’ rights.</p>
        <div class="section" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Compact Theory</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p01">In 1798, Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, outlawing malicious criticism of the government and authorizing the president to deport enemy aliens. In response, the Republican Jefferson drafted a resolution passed by Kentucky’s legislature, the first states’ rights manifesto. It set forth a compact theory, claiming that states had voluntarily entered into a “compact” to ratify the Constitution. Consequently, each state could engage in “nullification” and “judge for itself” if an act was constitutional and refuse to enforce it.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_015">Forrest McDonald, <em class="emphasis">States’ Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776–1876</em> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2000), 38–43.</span> However, Jefferson shelved states’ rights when, as president, he directed the national government to purchase the enormous Louisiana Territory from France in 1803.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p01">After the Revolutionary War, slavery waned in the North, where slaves were domestic servants or lone farmhands. In the South, labor-intensive crops on plantations were the basis of Southern prosperity, which relied heavily on slaves.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_016">This section draws on James M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p02">In 1850, Congress faced the prospect of new states carved from land captured in the Mexican War and debated whether they would be slave or free states. In a compromise, Congress admitted California as a free state but directed the national government to capture and return escaped slaves, even in free states. Officials in Northern states decried such an exertion of national power favoring the South. They passed state laws outlining rights for accused fugitive slaves and forbidding state officials from capturing fugitives.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_017">Thomas D. Morris, <em class="emphasis">Free Men All: The Personal Liberty Laws of the North, 1780–1861</em> (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974).</span> The Underground Railroad transporting escaped slaves northward grew. The saga of hunted fugitives was at the heart of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel <em class="emphasis">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, which sold more copies proportional to the American population than any book before or since.</p>
                <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s02_p08">The battle flag appeals to politicians seeking resonant images. But its multiple meanings can backfire. In 2003, former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, addressed the Democratic National Committee and said, “White folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals on the back ought to be voting with us, and not them [Republicans], because their kids don’t have health insurance either, and their kids need better schools too.” Dean received a rousing ovation, so he probably thought little of it when he told the <em class="emphasis">Des Moines Register</em>, “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_021">All quotes come from “Dems Battle over Confederate Flag,” CNN, November 2, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag">http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag</a>.</span> Dean, the Democratic front runner, was condemned by his rivals who questioned his patriotism, judgment, and racial sensitivity.

Since then, state officials’ efforts to defy national orders have been futile. In 1963, Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama to resist a court order to desegregate the all-white school. Eventually, he had no choice but to accede to federal marshals. In 1994, Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey, a pro-life Democrat, decreed he would not allow state officials to enforce a national order that state-run Medicaid programs pay for abortions in cases of rape and incest. He lost in court.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_023">David L.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dual Federalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p01">After the Civil War, the justices of the Supreme Court wrote, “The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_024"><em class="emphasis">Texas v. White</em>, 7 Wall. 700 (1869).</span> They endorsed dual federalism, a doctrine whereby national and state governments have clearly demarcated domains of power. The national government is supreme, but only in the areas where the Constitution authorizes it to act.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">The basis for dual federalism was a series of Supreme Court decisions early in the nineteenth century. The key decision was <em class="emphasis">McCulloch v. Maryland</em> (1819). The Court struck down a Maryland state tax on the Bank of the United States chartered by Congress. Chief Justice Marshall conceded that the Constitution gave Congress no explicit power to charter a national bank,<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_025"><em class="emphasis">McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).</span> but concluded that the Constitution’s necessary-and-proper clause enabled Congress and the national government to do whatever it deemed “convenient or useful” to exercise its powers. As for Maryland’s tax, he wrote, “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” Therefore, when a state’s laws interfere with the national government’s operation, the latter takes precedence. From the 1780s to the Great Depression of the 1930s, the size and reach of the national government were relatively limited. As late as 1932, local government raised and spent more than the national government or the states.</p>

Morone, <em class="emphasis">Hellfire Nation: The Politics of Sin in American History</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), chaps. 8–11.</span> In 1872, reformers led by Anthony Comstock persuaded Congress to pass laws blocking obscene material from being carried in the US mail.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p02">As a result of these laws, the national government gained the power to exclude material from the mail even if it was legal in individual states.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p03">The power of the national government also increased when prostitution became a focus of national policy. A 1910 exposé in <em class="emphasis">McClure’s</em> magazine roused President William Howard Taft to warn Congress about prostitution rings operating across state lines. The ensuing media frenzy depicted young white girls torn from rural homes and degraded by an urban “white slave trade.” Using the commerce clause, Congress passed the Mann Act to prohibit the transportation “in interstate commerce…of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_027">Quoted in James A. Morone, <em class="emphasis">Hellfire Nation: The Politics of Sin in American History</em> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), 266.</span> The bill turned enforcement over to a tiny agency concerned with antitrust and postal violations, the Bureau of Investigations. The Bureau aggressively investigated thousands of allegations of “immoral purpose,” including unmarried couples crossing state lines to wed and interracial married couples.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p04">The crusade to outlaw alcohol provided the most lasting expansion of national power. Reformers persuaded Congress in 1917 to bar importation of alcohol into dry states, and, in 1919, to amend the Constitution to allow for the nationwide prohibition of alcohol. Pervasive attempts to evade the law boosted organized crime, a rationale for the Bureau of Investigations to bloom into the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the equivalent of a national police force, in the 1920s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p05">Prohibition was repealed in 1933. But the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, its director from the 1920s to the 1970s, continued to call attention through news and entertainment media to the scourge of organized crime that justified its growth, political independence, and Hoover’s power. The FBI supervised film depictions of the lives of criminals like John Dillinger and long-running radio and television shows like <em class="emphasis">The FBI</em>. The heroic image of federal law enforcement would not be challenged until the 1960s when the classic film <em class="emphasis">Bonnie and Clyde</em> romanticized the tale of two small-time criminals into a saga of rebellious outsiders crushed by the ominous rise of authority across state lines.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Other national reforms in the late nineteenth century that increased the power of the national government were generated by reactions to industrialization, immigration, and urban growth. Crusading journalists decried the power of big business. Upton Sinclair’s 1906 novel <em class="emphasis">The Jungle</em> exposed miserable, unsafe working conditions in America’s factories. These reformers feared that states lacked the power or were reluctant to regulate railroads, inspect meat, or guarantee food and drug safety. They prompted Congress to use its powers under the commerce clause for economic regulation, starting with the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 to regulate railroads and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to outlaw monopolies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">The Supreme Court, defending dual federalism, limited such regulation.

Instead of a relatively clear separation of policy domains, national, state, and local governments would work together to try to respond to a wide range of problems.</p>

He argued that the national government could restore the economy more effectively than states or localities. He persuaded Congress to enact sweeping legislation. New Deal programs included boards enforcing wage and price guarantees; programs to construct buildings and bridges, develop national parks, and create artworks; and payments to farmers to reduce acreage of crops and stabilize prices.</p>

This reform has had little impact: negative news attention to unfunded mandates is easily displaced by dramatic, personalized issues that cry out for action. For example, in 1996, the story of Megan Kanka, a young New Jersey girl killed by a released sex offender living in her neighborhood, gained huge news attention. The same Congress that outlawed unfunded mandates passed “Megan’s Law”—including an unfunded mandate ordering state and local law enforcement officers to compile lists of sex offenders and send them to a registry run by the national government.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_p02">When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and the surrounding areas on August 29, 2005, it exposed federalism’s frailties. The state and local government were overwhelmed, yet there was uncertainty over which level of government should be in charge of rescue attempts. Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco refused to sign an order turning over the disaster response to federal authorities. She did not want to cede control of the National Guard and did not believe signing the order would hasten the arrival of the troops she had requested. President Bush failed to realize the magnitude of the disaster, then believed that the federal response was effective. In fact, as was obvious to anyone watching television, it was slow and ineffective. New Orleans mayor C. Ray Nagin and state officials accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of failing to deliver urgently needed help and of thwarting other efforts through red tape.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_p03">Hurricane Katrina was an exceptional challenge to federalism. Normally, competition between levels of government does not careen out of control, and federalism works, more or less. We have already discussed one reason: a legal hierarchy—in which national law is superior to state law, which in turn dominates local law—dictates who wins in clashes in domains where each may constitutionally act.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_p04">There are three other reasons.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_038">See also John D. Nugent, <em class="emphasis">Safeguarding Federalism: How States Protect Their Interests in National Policymaking</em> (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2009).</span> First, state and local governments provide crucial assistance to the national government. Second, national, state, and local levels have complementary capacities, providing distinct services and resources. Third, the fragmentation of the system is bridged by interest groups, notably the intergovernmental lobby that provides voices for state and local governments. We discuss each reason.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">State and local governments are essential parts of federalism because the federal government routinely needs them to execute national policy. State and local governments adjust the policies as best they can to meet their political preferences and their residents’ needs. Policies and the funds expended on them thus vary dramatically from one state to the next, even in national programs such as unemployment benefits.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_039">Thomas R.

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p03">The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act vastly expanded the national government’s supervision of public education with requirements for testing and accountability. Amid the final push toward enacting the law, Washington reporters for national newspapers were caught up in a remarkable story: the bipartisan coalition uniting staunch opponents President George W. Bush and liberal senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) civilly working together on a bold, historic piece of legislation. Dana Milbank’s <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> story was typical. Milbank termed the bill “the broadest rewriting of federal education policy in decades,” and he admired “Washington’s top bipartisan achievement of 2001.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_040">Dana Milbank, “With Fanfare, Bush Signs Education Bill,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, January 9, 2002, A3.</span> The looming problems of funding and implementing the act were obscured in the national media’s celebration of the lovefest.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p01">The second reason federalism often works is because national, state, and local governments specialize in different policy domains.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_043">This section draws on Paul E. Peterson, <em class="emphasis">The Price of Federalism</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1995).</span> The main focus of local and state government policy is economic development, broadly defined to include all policies that attract or keep businesses and enhance property values. States have traditionally taken the lead in highways, welfare, health, natural resources, and prisons.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_044">Thomas Anton, <em class="emphasis">American Federalism &amp; Public Policy: How the System Works</em> (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1988), table 3.3.</span> Local governments dominate in education, fire protection, sewerage, sanitation, airports, and parking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p02">The national government is central in policies to serve low-income and other needy persons. In these <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">redistributive policies</a><span class="glossdef">Policies whereby those who pay the taxes usually do not receive the service paid by the taxes.</span></span>, those paying for a service in taxes are not usually those receiving the service.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_045">This definition comes from Paul E. Peterson, Barry George Rabe, and Kenneth K. Wong, <em class="emphasis">When Federalism Works</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1986), 15.</span> These programs rarely get positive coverage in the local news, which often shows them as “something-for-nothing” benefits that undeserving individuals receive, not as ways to address national problems.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_046">Paul E. Peterson, Barry George Rabe, and Kenneth K. Wong, <em class="emphasis">When Federalism Works</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1986), 19.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p03">States cannot effectively provide redistributive benefits. It is impossible to stop people from moving away because they think they are paying too much in taxes for services. Nor can states with generous benefits stop outsiders from moving there—a key reason why very few states enacted broad health care coverage<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_047">Mark C. Rom and Paul E. Peterson, <em class="emphasis">Welfare Magnets: A New Case for a New National Standard</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1990).</span>—and why President Obama pressed for and obtained a national program. Note, however, that, acknowledging federalism, it is the states’ insurance commissioners who are supposed to interpret and enforce many of the provisions of the new federal health law</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p04">The three levels of government also rely on different sources of taxation to fund their activities and policies. The national government depends most heavily on the national income tax, based on people’s ability to pay. This enables it to shift funds away from the wealthier states (e.g., Connecticut, New Jersey, New Hampshire) to poorer states (e.g., New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p05">Taxes of local and state governments are more closely connected to services provided. Local governments depend mainly on property taxes, the more valuable the property the more people pay. State governments collect state income taxes but rely most on sales taxes gathered during presumably necessary or pleasurable consumer activity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p06">The language of “no new taxes” or “cutting taxes” is an easy slogan for politicians to feature in campaign ads and the news. As a result, governments often increase revenues on the sly, by lotteries, cigarette and alcohol taxes, toll roads, and sales taxes falling mostly on nonresidents (like hotel taxes or surcharges on car rentals).<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_048">Glenn R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p01">A third reason federalism often works is because interest groups and professional associations focus simultaneously on a variety of governments at the national, state, and local levels. With multiple points of entry, policy changes can occur in many ways.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_049">Thomas Anton, <em class="emphasis">American Federalism &amp; Public Policy: How the System Works</em> (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1988), chap. 5.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p02">In bottom-up change, a problem is first identified and addressed, but not resolved at a local level. People, and often the media, then pressure state and national governments to become involved. Bottom-up change can also take place through an interest group calling on Congress for help.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_050">David R. Berman, <em class="emphasis">Local Government and the States: Autonomy, Politics, and Policy</em> (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), 20.</span> In 1996, pesticide manufacturers, fed up with different regulations from state to state, successfully pushed Congress to set national standards to make for more uniform, and less rigorous, regulation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p03">In top-down change, breaking news events inspire simultaneous policy responses at various levels. Huge publicity for the 1991 beating that motorist Rodney King received from Los Angeles police officers propelled police brutality onto the agenda nationwide and inspired many state and local reforms.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_051">Regina G.

Walker, “Diffusion of Innovations among American States,” <em class="emphasis">American Political Science Review</em> 63 (1969): 880–99.</span> State and local officials watch what other state and local governments are doing. States can be “laboratories of democracy,” experimenting with innovative programs that spread to other states. They can also make problems worse with ineffective or misdirected policies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p05">These processes—bottom-up, top-down, and policy diffusion—are reinforced by the intergovernmental lobby. State and local governments lobby the president and Congress. Their officials band together in organizations, such as the National Governors Association, National Association of Counties, the US Conference of Mayors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. These associations trade information and pass resolutions to express common concerns to the national government. Such meetings are one-stop-shopping occasions for the news media to gauge nationwide trends in state and local government.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p01">The parties stand for different principles with regard to federalism. Democrats prefer policies to be set by the national government. They opt for national standards for consistency across states and localities, often through attaching stringent conditions to the use of national funds. Republicans decry such centralization and endorse devolution, giving (or, they say, “returning”) powers to the states—and seeking to shrink funds for the national government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p02">Principled distinctions often evaporate in practice. Both parties have been known to give priority to other principles over federalism and to pursue policy goals regardless of the impact on boundaries between national, state, and local governments.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_053">Paul L. Posner, <em class="emphasis">The Politics of Unfunded Mandates: Whither Federalism?</em> (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1998), 223.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p03">So Republicans sometimes champion a national policy while Democrats look to the states. In 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the state could not deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and officials in cities like San Francisco defied state laws and began marrying same-sex couples. Led by President George W. Bush, Republicans drafted an amendment to the US Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. Bush charged that “activist judges and local officials in some parts of the country are not letting up in their efforts to redefine marriage for the rest of America.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_054">Carl Hulse, “Senators Block Initiative to Ban Same-Sex Unions,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 15, 2004, A1.</span> Democrats, seeking to defuse the amendment’s appeal, argued that the matter should be left to each of the states. Democrats’ appeal to federalism swayed several Republican senators to vote to kill the amendment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p04">“The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,” enacted in February 2009, is another example. This was a dramatic response by Congress and the newly installed Obama administration to the country’s dire economic condition. It included many billions of dollars in a fiscal stabilization fund: aid to the states and localities struggling with record budget deficits and layoffs. Most Democratic members of Congress voted for the legislation even though it gave the funds unconditionally. Republicans opposed the legislation, preferring tax cuts over funding the states.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Woes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p01">The stimulus package was a stopgap measure. After spending or allocating most of the federal funds, many states and localities still faced a dire financial situation. The federal government, running a huge budget deficit, was unlikely to give the states significant additional funding. As unemployment went up and people’s incomes went down, states’ tax collections decreased and their expenditures for unemployment benefits and health care increased. Many states had huge funding obligations, particularly for pensions they owed and would owe to state workers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p02">State governors and legislators, particularly Republicans, had promised in their election campaigns not to raise taxes. They relied on cutting costs. They reduced aid to local governments and cities. They fired some state employees, reduced pay and benefits for others, slashed services and programs (including welfare, recreation, and corrections), borrowed funds, and engaged in accounting maneuvers to mask debt.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p03">At the University of California, for example, staff were put on furlough, which cut their pay by roughly 8 percent, teaching assistants were laid off, courses cut, library hours reduced, and recruitment of new faculty curtailed. Undergraduate fees (tuition) were increased by over 30 percent, provoking student protests and demonstrations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p04">At the local level, school districts’ budgets declined as they received less money from property taxes and from the states (about one quarter of all state spending goes to public schools). They fired teachers, hired few new ones (resulting in a horrendous job market for recent college graduates wanting to teach), enlarged classes, cut programs, shortened school hours, and closed schools.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p05">The federal system functions, more or less, because of the authority of national over state laws, which trump local laws; crucial assistance provided by states and local governments to execute national policy; the complementary capacities of the three levels of government; and the intergovernmental lobby. The functioning of the system is being challenged by the economic woes faced by government at all levels. The Democratic and Republican parties differ ideologically about federalism, although these differences can be changed to achieve political objectives.</p>

A few newspapers are also national. Reporters for these national outlets are largely based in New York and Washington, DC, and in a smattering of bureaus here and there across the country.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s02_p01">Local television stations transmit the news programs of the national networks to which they are affiliated. They broadcast local news on their own news shows. These shows are not devoid of substance, although it is easy to make fun of them as vapid and delivered by airheads, like Will Ferrell’s character Ron Burgundy in the 2004 comic film <em class="emphasis">Anchorman</em>. But they have only scattered national and international coverage, and attention to local and state government policies and politics is overshadowed by stories about isolated incidents such as crimes, car chases, and fires.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s02_p02">Almost all newspapers are local. Stories from the wire services enable them to include national and international highlights and some state items in their news, but most of their news is local. As their staff shrinks, they increasingly defer to powerful official sources in city hall or the police station for the substance of news. The news media serving smaller communities are even more vulnerable to pressure from local officials for favorable coverage and from advertisers who want a “feel-good” context for their paid messages.</p>

They can add a local angle by soliciting information and quotes from home-state members of Congress. Or, pooling of resources lets local television broadcasts make it look as though they have sent a reporter to Washington; a single reporter can send a feed to many stations by ending with an anonymous, “Now back to you.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s04_p02">In 2011, federalism took center stage with the efforts of Republican governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and related steps by the Republican governors of Indiana and Ohio, to save funds by stripping most of the collective bargaining power of the state’s public employee unions.

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s05_p01">Except for certain governors and attorneys general, the local media give little space in their news to state governments and their policies. One reason is that there are only a few truly statewide news outlets like New Hampshire’s <em class="emphasis">Manchester UnionLeader</em> or Iowa’s <em class="emphasis">Des Moines Register</em>. Another reason is that most state capitals are far from the state’s main metropolitan area. Examples such as Boston and Atlanta, where the state capital is the largest city, are unusual. The four largest states are more typical: their capitals (Sacramento, Austin, Tallahassee, and Albany) are far (and in separate media markets) from Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, and New York City.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s05_p02">Capital cities’ local news outlets do give emphasis to state government. But those cities are relatively small, so that news about state government usually goes to people involved with state government more than to the public in the state as a whole.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_s05_p03">State officials do not always mind the lack of scrutiny of state government. It allows some of them to get their views into the media. Governors, for example, have full-time press officers as key advisors and routinely give interviews and hold news conferences. According to governors’ press secretaries, their press releases are often printed word-for-word across the state; and the governors also gain positive coverage when they travel to other cities for press events such as signing legislation.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_056">Charles Layton and Jennifer Dorroh, “Sad State,” <em class="emphasis">American Journalism Review</em>, June 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=2562">http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=2562</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p01">The variety and range of national and local media offer opportunities for people in politics to gain leverage and influence. National policymakers, notably the president, use national news and entertainment media to reach a national public. But because local news media serve as a more unfiltered and thus less critical conduit to the public, they also seek and obtain positive publicity from them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p02">State governors and big-city mayors, especially when they have few formal powers or when they face a state legislature or city council filled with opponents, can parlay favorable media attention into political power.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_057">This section draws from Thad L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p03">Some state attorneys general are particularly adept and adroit at attracting positive media coverage through the causes they pursue, the (sometimes) outrageous accusations they announce, and the people they prosecute. One result is to put intolerable pressure on their targets to settle before trial. Another is reams of favorable publicity that they can parlay into a successful campaign for higher office, as Eliot Spitzer did in becoming governor of New York in 2006, and Andrew Cuomo in 2010.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p04">But to live by the media sword is sometimes to die by it, as Governor Spitzer discovered when the media indulged in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">feeding frenzy</a><span class="glossdef">Often excessive coverage by the media of every aspect of a story.</span></span> of stories about his engaging the services of prostitutes. He resigned from office in disgrace in March 2008. (See the documentary <em class="emphasis">Client 9</em>, listed in our “Recommended Viewing.”) Indeed, news attention can be unwanted and destructive. After he was arrested in December 2008 for corruption, the widespread negative coverage Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich received in the national, state, and local media contributed to his speedy impeachment and removal from office by the state legislature the next month.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p05">The media are also important because officials are news consumers in their own right.

        <h2 class="title editable block">New Media and Federalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p01">New technologies that enable far-flung individuals quickly to obtain news from many locales can help people understand the many dimensions of federalism. People in politics in one state can, with a few keystrokes, find out how an issue is being dealt with in all fifty states, thus providing a boost for ideas and issues to travel more quickly than ever across state lines. The National Conference of State Legislatures, as part of its mission to “offer a variety of services to help lawmakers tailor policies that will work for their state and their constituents,” maintains a website, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncsl.org">http://www.ncsl.org</a>, with a motto “Where Policy Clicks!” allowing web surfers to search the latest information from a whole range of states about “state and federal issues A to Z.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p02">But new media create a challenge for federalism. They erode the once-close connection of media to geographically defined communities. Consumers can tune in to distant satellite and cable outlets as easily as local television stations. Cell phones make it as convenient (and cheap) to call across the country as across the street. The Internet and the web, with their listservs, websites, weblogs, chat rooms, and podcasts, permit ready and ongoing connections to groups and communities that can displace individuals’ commitment to and involvement in their physical surroundings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p03">In one sense, new technologies simply speed up a development launched in the 1960s, when, as one scholar writes, “one type of group—the place-based group that federalism had honored—yielded to groups otherwise defined, as by race, age, disability, or orientation to an issue or cause.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_061">Martha Derthick, <em class="emphasis">Keeping the Compound Republic: Essays on American Federalism</em> (Washington, DC: Brookings, 2001), 152.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p04">Yet the vitality of state and local governments, presenting so many opportunities for people in politics to intervene, reminds us that federalism is not about to wither and die. In the end, the new technologies may enable individuals and groups more efficiently to manage the potentially overwhelming amount of information about what is going on in policymaking—and to navigate quickly and adroitly the dazzling and bemusing complexity of American federalism.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p05">The US media system blends national, state, and local outlets. Issues and stories move from one level to another. This enables people in politics to gain influence but can undermine them. New media technologies, fostering quick communication across vast expanses, allows people to learn and understand more about federalism but challenge federalism’s geographical foundation. Federalism seems like a daunting obstacle course, but it also opens up many opportunities for political action.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Michael Barker versus the School Board</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p06">As Hamilton predicted in Federalist No. 28, if the people are frustrated at one level of government, they can make their voice heard and win policy battles at another. Federalism looks like a daunting obstacle course, yet it opens up a vast array of opportunities for political action.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p07">Michael Barker did not set out to push the Louisiana state legislature for a new law. In 2003, Barker, a seventeen-year-old high school junior from the town of Jena, had wondered if his school district might save money on computer equipment by making smarter purchases. He sent four letters to the LaSalle Parish School Board requesting information about computer expenditures. He was rebuffed by the superintendent of schools, who notified him that a state law allowed public officials to deny requests for public records from anyone under the age of eighteen.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p08">Barker did not understand why minors—including student journalists—had no right to access public information. Stymied locally, he aimed at the state government. He conducted an Internet search and discovered a statewide nonprofit organization, the Public Affairs Research Council (PAR), that promotes public access. Barker contacted PAR, which helped him develop a strategy to research the issue thoroughly and contact Jena’s state representative, Democrat Thomas Wright. Wright agreed to introduce House Bill 492 to strike the “age of majority” provision from the books. Barker testified in the state capital of Baton Rouge at legislative hearings on behalf of the bill, saying, “Our education system strives daily to improve upon people’s involvement in the democratic process. This bill would allow young people all over the state of Louisiana to be involved with the day-to-day operations of our state government.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p09">But Barker’s crusade had just begun. A state senator who had a personal beef with Representative Wright tried to block passage of the bill. Barker contacted a newspaper reporter who wrote a story about the controversy. The ensuing media spotlight caused the opposition to back down. After the bill was passed and signed into law by Governor Kathleen Blanco, Barker set up a website to share his experiences and to provide advice to young people who want to influence government.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn03_062">This information comes from Jan Moller, “Teen’s Curiosity Spurs Open-Records Bill,” New Orleans <em class="emphasis">Times-Picayune</em>, April 14, 2004; and Wendy Scahetzel Lesko, “Teen Changes Open-Records Law,” <em class="emphasis">Youth Activism Project, E-News</em>, July 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youthactivism.com/newsletter-archives/YA-July04.html">http://www.youthactivism.com/newsletter-archives/YA-July04.html</a>.</span></p>
