        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Political Culture?</h2>

It encompasses the deep-rooted, well-established political traits that are characteristic of a society. Political culture takes into account the attitudes, values, and beliefs that people in a society have about the political system, including standard assumptions about the way that government works. As political scientist W. Lance Bennett notes, the components of political culture can be difficult to analyze. “They are rather like the lenses in a pair of glasses: they are not the things we see when we look at the world; they are the things we see with.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_001">W. Lance Bennett, <em class="emphasis">Public Opinion in American Politics</em> (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980), 368.</span> Political culture helps build community and facilitate communication because people share an understanding of how and why political events, actions, and experiences occur in their country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p02">Political culture includes formal rules as well as customs and traditions, sometimes referred to as “habits of the heart,” that are passed on generationally. People agree to abide by certain formal rules, such as the country’s constitution and codified laws. They also live by unstated rules: for example, the willingness in the United States to accept the outcomes of elections without resorting to violence. Political culture sets the boundaries of acceptable political behavior in a society.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_002">Daniel J. Elazar, <em class="emphasis">The American Mosaic</em> (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1994).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p03">While the civic culture in the United States has remained relatively stable over time, shifts have occurred as a result of transforming experiences, such as war, economic crises, and other societal upheavals, that have reshaped attitudes and beliefs.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_003">Ronald Inglehart, <em class="emphasis">Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990).</span> Key events, such as the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Great Depression, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the terrorist attacks of 9/11 have influenced the political worldviews of American citizens, especially young people, whose political values and attitudes are less well established.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">American Political Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Political culture consists of a variety of different elements. Some aspects of culture are abstract, such as political beliefs and values. Other elements are visible and readily identifiable, such as rituals, traditions, symbols, folklore, and heroes. These aspects of political culture can generate feelings of national pride that form a bond between people and their country. Political culture is not monolithic. It consists of diverse subcultures based on group characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and social circumstances, including living in a particular place or in a certain part of the country. We will now examine these aspects of political culture in the American context.</p>

This core American belief is found in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, which states that “all men are created equal” and that people are endowed with the unalienable rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Americans endorse the intrinsic equal worth of all people. Survey data consistently indicate that between 80 percent and 90 percent of Americans believe that it is essential to treat all people equally, regardless of race or ethnic background.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_004">James Davison Hunter and Carl Bowman, <em class="emphasis">The State of Disunion</em> (Charlottesville, VA: In Media Res Educational Foundation, 1996); Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, <em class="emphasis">Values Survey</em> (Washington, DC: Pew Research Center, March 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p02">Core American political values are vested in what is often called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">American creed</a><span class="glossdef">Belief in the United States “as a Government of the people, by the people, for the people, who powers are derived from the consent of the governed.”</span></span>.

The events of 9/11 ignited Americans’ patriotic values, resulting in many public displays of support for the country, its democratic form of government, and authority figures in public-service jobs, such as police and firefighters. The press has scrutinized politicians for actions that are perceived to indicate a lack of patriotism, and the perception that a political leader is not patriotic can generate controversy. In the 2008 presidential election, a minor media frenzy developed over Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s “patriotism problem.” The news media debated the significance of Obama’s not wearing a flag lapel pin on the campaign trail and his failure to place his hand over his heart during the playing of the national anthem.</p>

In fact, Washington was not a gifted athlete, and silver dollars did not exist when he was a youth. The origin of this folklore is an episode related by his step-grandson, who wrote that Washington had once thrown a piece of slate across a very narrow portion of the Rappahannock River in Virginia.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_014">George Washington’s Mount Vernon, “Did George Washington really throw a silver dollar across the Potomac River?,” accessed February 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mountvernon.org/knowledge/index.cfm/fuseaction/view/KnowledgeID/20">http://www.mountvernon.org/knowledge/index.cfm/fuseaction/view/KnowledgeID/20</a>.</span></p>

A nation’s political culture is in part defined by its heroes who, in theory, embody the best of what that country has to offer.

People also can achieve hero status because of other factors, such as celebrity status, athletic excellence, and wealth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_s05_p02">Shifts in the people whom a nation identifies as heroes reflect changes in cultural values. Prior to the twentieth century, political figures were preeminent among American heroes. These included patriotic leaders, such as American-flag designer Betsy Ross; prominent presidents, such as Abraham Lincoln; and military leaders, such as Civil War General Stonewall Jackson, a leader of the Confederate army. People learned about these leaders from biographies, which provided information about the valiant actions and patriotic attitudes that contributed to their success.</p>

Popular culture became a powerful mechanism for elevating people to hero status beginning around the 1920s. As mass media, especially motion pictures, radio, and television, became an important part of American life, entertainment and sports personalities who received a great deal of publicity became heroes to many people who were awed by their celebrity.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_015">Fred I.

The tenure of business leaders as American heroes was short-lived, however, as media reports of the lavish lifestyles and widespread criminal misconduct of some corporation heads led people to become disillusioned. The incarceration of Wall Street investment advisor Bernard Madoff made international headlines as he was alleged to have defrauded investors of billions of dollars.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_016">Sandra Yin, “Shifting Careers,” <em class="emphasis">American Demographics</em>, 23, no. 12 (December 2001): 39–40.</span></p>

They can develop around groups with distinct interests, such as those based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, social class, religion, and sexual preference. Subcultures also can be geographically based. Political scientist Daniel Elazar identified regional political subcultures, rooted in American immigrant settlement patterns, that influenced the way that government was constituted and practiced in different locations across the nation. The moral political subculture, which is present in New England and the Midwest, promotes the common good over individual values. The individual political subculture, which is evident in the middle Atlantic states and the West, is more concerned with private enterprise than societal interests. The traditional political subculture, which is found in the South, reflects a hierarchical societal structure in which social and familial ties are central to holding political power.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_018">Daniel J.

            <p class="simpara">The Hip-Hop Subculture</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p02">A cohort of black Americans has been labeled the hip-hop generation by scholars and social observers. The hip-hop generation is a subculture of generation X (people born between 1965 and 1984) that identifies strongly with hip-hop music as a unifying force. Its heroes come from the ranks of prominent music artists, including Grandmaster Flash, Chuck D, Run DMC, Ice Cube, Sister Souljah, Nikki D, and Queen Latifah. While a small number of people who identify with this subculture advocate extreme politics, including violence against political leaders, the vast majority are peaceful, law-abiding citizens.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_019">Bakari Kitwana, <em class="emphasis">The Hip-Hop Generation</em> (New York: Basic Civitas Books, 2002).</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p03">The hip-hop subculture emerged in the early 1970s in New York City. Hip-hop music began with party-oriented themes, but by 1982 it was focusing heavily on political issues. Unlike the preceding civil rights generation—a black subculture of baby boomers (people born immediately after World War II) that concentrated on achieving equal rights—the hip-hop subculture does not have an overarching political agenda. The messages passed on to the subculture by the music are highly varied and often contradictory. Some lyrics express frustration about the poverty, lack of educational and employment opportunities, and high crime rates that plague segments of the black community. Other songs provide public service messages, such as those included on the <em class="emphasis">Stop the Violence</em> album featuring Public Enemy and MC Lyte, and Salt-N-Pepa’s “Let’s Talk about AIDS.” Music associated with the gangsta rap genre, which was the product of gang culture and street wars in South Central Los Angeles, promotes violence, especially against women and authority figures, such as the police. It is from these lyrics that the mass media derive their most prominent frames when they cover the hip-hop subculture.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_020">Manning Marable, “The Politics of Hip-Hop,” <em class="emphasis">The Urban Think Tank</em>, 2 (2002). <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/594.html">http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/594.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p04">Media coverage of the hip-hop subculture focuses heavily on negative events and issues, while ignoring the socially constructive messages of many musicians. The subculture receives most of its media attention in response to the murder of prominent artists, such as Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., or the arrest of musicians for violating the law, usually for a weapons- or drug-related charge. A prominent news frame is how violence in the music’s lyrics translates into real-life violence. As hip-hop music became more popular with suburban white youth in the 1990s, the news media stepped up its warnings about the dangers of this subculture.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p05">Media reports of the hip-hop subculture also coincide with the release of successful albums. Since 1998, hip-hop and rap have been the top-selling record formats. The dominant news frame is that the hip-hop subculture promotes selfish materialist values. This is illustrated by news reports about the cars, homes, jewelry, and other commodities purchased by successful musicians and their promoters.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_021">Autumn Lewis, “Vilification of Black Youth Culture by the Media” (master’s thesis, Georgetown University, 2003).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p01">One of the hallmarks of American culture is its racial and ethnic diversity. In the early twentieth century, the playwright Israel Zangwill coined the phrase “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">melting pot</a><span class="glossdef">Metaphor used to describe how immigrants from many different backgrounds come together in the United States and that assumes that the distinct habits, customs, and traditions of particular groups disappear as their members assimilate into the larger culture.</span></span>” to describe how immigrants from many different backgrounds came together in the United States. The melting pot metaphor assumed that over time the distinct habits, customs, and traditions associated with particular groups would disappear as people assimilated into the larger culture. A uniquely American culture would emerge that accommodated some elements of diverse immigrant cultures in a new context.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_022">Lawrence H. Fuchs, <em class="emphasis">The American Kaleidoscope</em>. (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1990).</span> For example, American holiday celebrations incorporate traditions from other nations. Many common American words originate from other languages. Still, the melting pot concept fails to recognize that immigrant groups do not entirely abandon their distinct identities. Racial and ethnic groups maintain many of their basic characteristics, but at the same time, their cultural orientations change through marriage and interactions with others in society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p02">Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward greater acceptance of America’s cultural diversity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Multiculturalism</a><span class="glossdef">An appreciation of the unique cultural heritage of racial and ethnic groups in the United States, some of whom seek to preserve their native languages and lifestyles.</span></span> celebrates the unique cultural heritage of racial and ethnic groups, some of whom seek to preserve their native languages and lifestyles.

        <p class="para editable block" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p03">Multiculturalism has been embraced by many Americans, and it has been promoted formally by institutions. Elementary and secondary schools have adopted curricula to foster understanding of cultural diversity by exposing students to the customs and traditions of racial and ethnic groups. As a result, young people today are more tolerant of diversity in society than any prior generation has been. Government agencies advocate tolerance for diversity by sponsoring Hispanic and Asian American/Pacific Islander heritage weeks. The US Postal Service has introduced stamps depicting prominent Americans from diverse backgrounds.</p>

Franklin, a photographer for Bergen County, New Jersey’s <em class="emphasis">Record</em>, photographed three firefighters, Billy Eisengrein, George Johnson, and Dan McWilliams, raising a flag amid the smoldering rubble of the World Trade Center. Labeled by the press “the photo seen ‘round the world,” his image came to symbolize the strength, resilience, and heroism of Americans in the face of a direct attack on their homeland.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p06">Developer Bruce Ratner commissioned a nineteen-foot-tall, $180,000 bronze statue based on the photograph to stand in front of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) headquarters in Brooklyn. When the statue prototype was unveiled, it revealed that the faces of two of the three white firefighters who had originally raised the flag had been replaced with those of black and Hispanic firefighters. Ratner and the artist who designed the statue claimed that the modification of the original image represented an effort to promote America’s multicultural heritage and tolerance for diversity. The change had been authorized by the FDNY leadership.<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_025">Rod Dreher, “The Bravest Speak,” <em class="emphasis">National Review Online</em>, January 16, 2002.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p07">The modification of the famous photo raised the issue of whether it is valid to alter historical fact in order to promote a cultural value. A heated controversy broke out over the statue. Supporters of the change believed that the statue was designed to honor all firefighters, and that representing their diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds was warranted. Black and Hispanic firefighters were among the 343 who had lost their lives at the World Trade Center. Kevin James of the Vulcan Society, which represents black firefighters, defended the decision by stating, “The symbolism is far more important than representing the actual people. I think the artistic expression of diversity would supersede any concern over factual correctness.”<span class="footnote" id="paletz_1.0-fn06_026">“Ground Zero Statue Criticized for ‘Political Correctness,’” <em class="emphasis">CNN</em>, January 12, 2002, http//www.cnn.com.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p08">Opponents claimed that since the statue was not meant to be a tribute to firefighters, but rather a depiction of an actual event, the representation needed to be historically accurate. They drew a parallel to the famous 1945 Associated Press photograph of six Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima during World War II and the historically precise memorial that was erected in Arlington, Virginia. Opponents also felt that it was wrong to politicize the statue by making it part of a dialogue on race. The proposed statue promoted an image of diversity within the FDNY that did not mirror reality. Of the FDNY’s 11,495 firefighters, 2.7 percent are black and 3.2 percent are Latino, percentages well below the percentage these groups represent in the overall population.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p09">Some people suggested a compromise—two statues. They proposed that the statue based on the Franklin photo should reflect historical reality; a second statue, celebrating multiculturalism, should be erected in front of another FDNY station and include depictions of rescue workers of diverse backgrounds at the World Trade Center site. Plans for any type of statue were abandoned as a result of the controversy.</p>

            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p10">Political culture is defined by the ideologies, values, beliefs, norms, customs, traditions, and heroes characteristic of a nation. People living in a particular political culture share views about the nature and operation of government. Political culture changes over time in response to dramatic events, such as war, economic collapse, or radical technological developments. The core American values of democracy and capitalism are vested in the American creed. American exceptionalism is the idea that the country has a special place in the world because of the circumstances surrounding its founding and the settling of a vast frontier.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p11">Rituals, traditions, and symbols bond people to their culture and can stimulate national pride. Folklore consists of stories about a nation’s leaders and heroes; often embellished, these stories highlight the character traits that are desirable in a nation’s citizens. Heroes are important for defining a nation’s political culture.</p>
            <p class="para" id="paletz_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p12">America has numerous subcultures based on geographic region; demographic, personal, and social characteristics; religious affiliation, and artistic inclinations. America’s unique multicultural heritage is vested in the various racial and ethnic groups who have settled in the country, but conflicts can arise when subgroups compete for societal resources.</p>
